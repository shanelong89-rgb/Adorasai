# Remember Me & Mobile Session Persistence - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented "Remember Me" functionality with automatic session persistence for mobile PWA users. Users now stay signed in when they close and reopen the app.

## Changes Made

### 1. API Client Updates (`/utils/api/client.ts`)
- **Dual Storage Support**: Now supports both localStorage (persistent) and sessionStorage (session-only)
- **Remember Me Parameter**: `signin()` method accepts a `rememberMe` boolean parameter
- **Smart Token Storage**: 
  - When `rememberMe = true`: Token stored in localStorage (persists across browser sessions)
  - When `rememberMe = false`: Token stored in sessionStorage (cleared when browser/app closes)
- **Token Retrieval Priority**: Checks sessionStorage first, then localStorage
- **Imported PWA Installer**: Added import for future PWA-specific enhancements

### 2. Login Screen Updates (`/components/LoginScreen.tsx`)
- **Remember Me Checkbox**: Added checkbox below password field
- **Default Checked**: Defaults to `true` for better mobile UX
- **Email Auto-fill**: Saves and auto-fills email when "Remember Me" is checked
- **Preference Storage**: Stores user preference in localStorage
- **Auto-load Saved Credentials**: On mount, loads saved email and Remember Me preference

### 3. Auth Context Updates (`/utils/api/AuthContext.tsx`)
- **Updated signin**: Now accepts optional `rememberMe` parameter (defaults to `true`)
- **Auto-remember Signups**: New signups always use localStorage for better UX
- **Token Persistence**: Properly manages access token based on Remember Me preference

### 4. App Content Updates (`/components/AppContent.tsx`)
- **Loading State**: Added proper loading screen while checking authentication
- **Prevents Flash**: No longer shows welcome screen briefly during auth initialization
- **Smooth UX**: Users see a loading spinner instead of navigation flicker

## How It Works

### For New Users (Signup)
1. User creates account and completes onboarding
2. Token automatically saved to localStorage (always remembered)
3. When app is closed and reopened, user is automatically signed in
4. No need to enter credentials again

### For Returning Users (Login)
1. User visits login screen
2. If previously checked "Remember Me":
   - Email is auto-filled
   - Checkbox is pre-checked
3. User can choose to:
   - **Keep "Remember Me" checked**: Stay signed in permanently (localStorage)
   - **Uncheck "Remember Me"**: Session-only login (sessionStorage - clears on app close)
4. Login preferences are saved for next visit

### Mobile PWA Behavior
1. User installs Adoras as PWA on mobile device
2. Signs in with "Remember Me" checked (default)
3. Closes the app completely
4. Reopens the app
5. ✅ **Automatically signed in** - no login required!

## User Experience

### Before Implementation
- Users had to sign in every time they opened the app
- Lost session when closing browser/app
- Poor mobile experience

### After Implementation
- First-time users: Sign in once, stay signed in forever
- Returning users: Can choose session-only or persistent login
- Mobile users: Seamless experience like native apps
- No flash of login screen during app startup
- Smooth loading state during auth check

## Technical Details

### Storage Strategy
```javascript
// Remember Me checked (default)
localStorage.setItem('adoras_access_token', token);
localStorage.setItem('adoras_remember_email', email);
localStorage.setItem('adoras_remember_me', 'true');

// Remember Me unchecked
sessionStorage.setItem('adoras_access_token', token);
localStorage.removeItem('adoras_remember_email');
localStorage.removeItem('adoras_remember_me');
```

### Token Retrieval Priority
1. Check sessionStorage (current session)
2. Check localStorage (remembered session)
3. Return null if not found

### Auto-login Flow
```
App Start
  → AuthContext loads
  → Checks for token in storage
  → If found: Validates with backend
  → If valid: Auto-login to dashboard
  → If invalid: Clear token, show welcome screen
  → Loading state shown during check
```

## Security Considerations

### Safe
- Tokens are still time-limited by backend
- Users can manually sign out to clear all tokens
- Session-only option available for shared devices
- No passwords stored locally (only tokens)

### Best Practices
- Users on shared devices should uncheck "Remember Me"
- Tokens stored in browser storage (industry standard)
- PWA apps run in isolated contexts (same as native apps)

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Sign in with "Remember Me" checked - stays signed in
- [x] Sign in with "Remember Me" unchecked - session-only
- [x] Close and reopen browser - persistent login works
- [x] Close and reopen PWA app - stays signed in
- [x] Sign out - clears all stored tokens
- [x] Email auto-fill works when returning
- [x] Loading state shows during auth check
- [x] No flash of welcome screen
- [x] Mobile PWA behavior correct

## Files Modified

1. `/utils/api/client.ts` - Dual storage support
2. `/components/LoginScreen.tsx` - Remember Me UI
3. `/utils/api/AuthContext.tsx` - Remember Me logic
4. `/components/AppContent.tsx` - Loading state
5. `/REMEMBER_ME_MOBILE_PERSISTENCE.md` - This documentation

## User-Facing Changes

### Login Screen
- New "Remember me on this device" checkbox
- Pre-filled email for returning users
- Checkbox defaults to checked

### Mobile App Experience
- Opens directly to dashboard (if previously signed in)
- No need to re-enter credentials
- Feels like a native mobile app

## Next Steps

Users can now:
1. Sign in once and stay signed in (recommended for personal devices)
2. Choose session-only login for shared devices
3. Sign out anytime to clear stored credentials
