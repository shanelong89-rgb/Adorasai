# Persistent Connection State Fix

## Problem
When logging in as shanelong@gmail.com, the Allison chat showed 0 memories initially, with nothing loading in chat or media library until after clicking around or switching profiles. The dashboard also displayed 0 memories even when data existed. Additionally, the app didn't remember which connection was last active when logging back in.

## Root Causes
1. **No State Persistence**: The app always defaulted to the first active connection on login, not the one the user was last viewing
2. **Race Condition in Data Loading**: Memories were being loaded for all connections in parallel, causing timing issues where the global `memories` state wasn't properly set for the active connection
3. **Inefficient Loading Strategy**: All connections loaded simultaneously on login, slowing down the initial display of the active connection's data

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Connection State Persistence
Added localStorage persistence to remember the last active connection per user:

**In `handleSwitchStoryteller`:**
```typescript
// Persist the last active connection to localStorage
if (user?.id) {
  localStorage.setItem(`adoras_last_active_connection_${user.id}`, storytellerId);
  console.log(`üíæ Persisted last active connection: ${storytellerId}`);
}
```

**In `handleSwitchLegacyKeeper`:**
```typescript
// Persist the last active connection to localStorage
if (user?.id) {
  localStorage.setItem(`adoras_last_active_connection_${user.id}`, legacyKeeperId);
  console.log(`üíæ Persisted last active connection: ${legacyKeeperId}`);
}
```

### 2. Connection Restoration on Login
Modified `transformConnectionsToStorytellers` and `transformConnectionsToLegacyKeepers` to:
- Check localStorage for the last active connection
- Restore that connection if it still exists and is active
- Fall back to the first active connection if the saved one is unavailable

**Example from `transformConnectionsToStorytellers`:**
```typescript
// Try to restore the last active connection from localStorage
let targetConnection: Storyteller | undefined;
if (user?.id) {
  const lastActiveId = localStorage.getItem(`adoras_last_active_connection_${user.id}`);
  if (lastActiveId) {
    targetConnection = storytellerList.find((s) => s.id === lastActiveId && s.isConnected);
    if (targetConnection) {
      console.log(`   ‚ôªÔ∏è Restoring last active connection: ${targetConnection.name} (${lastActiveId})`);
    } else {
      console.log(`   ‚ö†Ô∏è Last active connection ${lastActiveId} not found or not active, falling back to first`);
    }
  }
}

// If no restored connection, use first active connection as default
if (!targetConnection) {
  targetConnection = storytellerList.find((s) => s.isConnected);
  console.log(`   First active storyteller:`, targetConnection);
}
```

### 3. Prioritized Memory Loading
Changed the memory loading strategy to prioritize the active connection:

**Before:**
- Load memories for ALL connections in parallel
- Try to set global state after all loads complete
- Race conditions caused the active connection's memories to not display

**After:**
- Load memories for the ACTIVE connection FIRST (with await)
- This ensures the global `memories` state is set immediately
- Then load other connections' memories in the background (for notification badges)
- No blocking, faster initial display

**Code:**
```typescript
// Load memories for the active connection FIRST (priority)
console.log(`   üì¶ Loading memories for active connection: ${targetConnection.id}...`);
await loadMemoriesForConnection(targetConnection.id);

// Then load memories for all other connections in background (for notification badges)
const otherConnections = storytellerList.filter(s => s.id !== targetConnection!.id);
if (otherConnections.length > 0) {
  console.log(`   üì¶ Loading memories for ${otherConnections.length} other connections in background...`);
  Promise.all(otherConnections.map(s => loadMemoriesForConnection(s.id))).catch(err => {
    console.warn('‚ö†Ô∏è Some background memory loads failed:', err);
  });
}
```

## Benefits

### User Experience
1. **Instant Recognition**: When you log back in, you see the same connection you were viewing before
2. **Faster Load Times**: Active connection's data loads first, other connections load in background
3. **Reliable Display**: Dashboard, chat, and media library all show the correct data immediately
4. **No More "0 Memories" Bug**: Global memories state is properly set on login

### Technical Improvements
1. **State Persistence**: User preferences are preserved across sessions
2. **Sequential Priority Loading**: Critical data loads first, non-critical data loads in background
3. **Better Error Handling**: Background loads can fail without blocking the UI
4. **Clearer Logging**: Console shows exactly which connection is being restored and why

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Log in as shanelong@gmail.com
- [ ] Verify Allison's chat shows memories immediately (no "0 memories")
- [ ] Check dashboard displays correct memory count
- [ ] Switch to another connection (if available)
- [ ] Log out and log back in
- [ ] Verify the last active connection is restored
- [ ] Check that all tabs (Prompts, Chat, Media Library) show data immediately

## Files Modified
- `/components/AppContent.tsx`

## Technical Notes
- localStorage key format: `adoras_last_active_connection_${userId}`
- Only active connections are restored (pending connections are ignored)
- Falls back gracefully if saved connection no longer exists
- Background loading doesn't block UI rendering
