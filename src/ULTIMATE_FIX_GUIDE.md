## ⚡ THE 2-MINUTE FIX (Guaranteed to Work!)

### **Fix #1: Update package.json (60 seconds)**

#### **Quick Way - Change One Word:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/shanelong89-rgb/Adorasai/blob/main/package.json
2. Click pencil ✏️
3. Find: `"motion": "^10.16.0",`
4. Change to: `"framer-motion": "^10.16.0",`
5. Commit: "Fix: Use framer-motion instead of motion"

#### **OR Safe Way - Replace Entire File:**
1. Copy ALL content from `FINAL_PACKAGE_JSON.txt`
2. Go to: https://github.com/shanelong89-rgb/Adorasai/blob/main/package.json
3. Click pencil ✏️
4. Delete all, paste
5. Commit

### **Fix #2: Update vite.config.ts (60 seconds)**

#### **Quick Way - Add One Line:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/shanelong89-rgb/Adorasai/blob/main/vite.config.ts
2. Click pencil ✏️
3. Find line 15: `alias: {`
4. RIGHT AFTER that line, add:
   ```typescript
   'motion/react': 'framer-motion',
   ```
5. Should look like:
   ```typescript
   resolve: {
     alias: {
       'motion/react': 'framer-motion',
       // Remove version specifiers from imports
       'sonner@2.0.3': 'sonner',
   ```
6. Commit: "Add motion/react alias to vite config"

#### **OR Safe Way - Replace Entire File:**
1. Copy ALL content from `FINAL_VITE_CONFIG.txt`
2. Go to: https://github.com/shanelong89-rgb/Adorasai/blob/main/vite.config.ts
3. Click pencil ✏️
4. Delete all, paste
5. Commit

## 🎯 WHY THIS WORKS

### **The Problem:**
Your code imports:
```typescript
import { motion } from 'motion/react';
```

But the package on npm is called `framer-motion`, not `motion`.

### **The Solution:**
1. Install `framer-motion` package ✅
2. Tell Vite to map `'motion/react'` → `'framer-motion'` ✅

This way, your code doesn't need to change!

## 📋 WHAT YOU'RE CHANGING

### **In package.json:**
```diff
  "dependencies": {
    "tailwind-merge": "^2.2.0",
-   "motion": "^10.16.0",
+   "framer-motion": "^10.16.0",
    "@radix-ui/react-accordion": "^1.1.2",
```

### **In vite.config.ts:**
```diff
  resolve: {
    alias: {
+     'motion/react': 'framer-motion',
      'sonner@2.0.3': 'sonner',
```
