# 🚀 QUICK TEST - PWA Icons & Fullscreen

## ⚡ 3-Step Test

### 1. Refresh & Check Console 
Open Safari on your iPhone and visit: `https://access-date-65858606.figma.site`

**Look for these logs:**
```
🎨 Generating PWA icons...
✅ Generated 5 icons
✅ PWA Meta Tags Injected
```

---

### 2. Run PWA Debug
Tap **"🔍 PWA Debug"** button (bottom-right)

**Expected Output:**
```json
{
  "manifestUrl": "blob:https://...",  ✅ (not "Not found")
  "appleIcons": [
    { "href": "data:image/png;base64,...", "sizes": "180x180" },
    { "href": "data:image/png;base64,...", "sizes": "152x152" },
    { "href": "data:image/png;base64,...", "sizes": "120x120" }
  ],  ✅ (not empty [])
  "metaTags": {
    "capable": "yes",  ✅ (not {})
    "statusBar": "black-translucent",
    "title": "Adoras"
  }
}
```

---

### 3. Reinstall App
1. **Delete** old Adoras app from home screen
2. **Close Safari** completely
3. **Open Safari** → Go to your URL
4. **Share → "Add to Home Screen" → Add**

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Custom Adoras logo appears
- ✅ App opens fullscreen (no Safari bars)
- ✅ PWA Debug shows `"isStandalone": true`

---

## ❓ What If It Doesn't Work?

### Case 1: PWA Debug shows empty results
**Issue:** Component hasn't loaded yet
**Fix:** Wait 3 seconds, refresh page

### Case 2: Icons still empty after refresh
**Issue:** Shopify URL blocked or CORS issue
**Fix:** Check console for errors - fallback "A" logo should still work

### Case 3: Fullscreen not working
**Issue:** Didn't reinstall properly
**Fix:** 
1. Delete app from home screen
2. Settings → Safari → Clear History
3. Reinstall using Safari's "Add to Home Screen"
