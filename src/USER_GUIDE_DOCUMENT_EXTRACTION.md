# User Guide: Document Text Extraction 📄

### Document Quality
- ✅ **Clear scans** work best - ensure good lighting and focus
- ✅ **High resolution** images provide better accuracy
- ✅ **Straight orientation** - try to align documents properly
- ⚠️ **Handwritten text** may not extract accurately

### Document Types
- 📄 **Text-heavy documents** (letters, reports) extract very well
- 📊 **Tables and spreadsheets** preserve basic structure
- 🖼️ **Images with text** (signs, certificates) work well

## Troubleshooting

### "Extract Text with AI" button not appearing?
- The document may already have extracted text
- Check if there's a "Show/Hide" toggle instead

### Extraction taking too long?
- Large documents (50+ pages) may take 10-20 seconds
- Check your internet connection
- Try again if it times out

### Getting an error message?
- **"AI features not configured"** - The Groq API key needs to be set up (contact support)
- **"Failed to extract text"** - Try uploading the document again
- **Poor quality document** - Try rescanning with better lighting

### Extracted text looks wrong?
- Open Edit Memory and manually correct the text
- The AI does its best but may make mistakes with:
  - Handwritten text
  - Poor quality scans
  - Complex layouts
  - Decorative fonts

- 🗑️ **Not stored by AI**: Documents are only analyzed, not stored by Groq
