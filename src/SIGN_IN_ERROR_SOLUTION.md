# ✅ Sign In Error - SOLUTION

## The Error You're Seeing

```
⚠️ Authentication required [/auth/signin]: Invalid or expired token
❌ Sign in failed with error: Sign in failed: Invalid login credentials
Sign in failed: Invalid login credentials
```

## What This Means

**Your authentication system is working correctly!** ✅

The error "Invalid login credentials" from Supabase means you're trying to sign in with an email/password combination that **doesn't exist** in your database.

Think of it like trying to unlock a door with a key that was never made for that door - the lock (authentication system) is working perfectly, but the key (credentials) doesn't match any existing account.

## The Solution

You have **two options**:

### Option 1: Sign Up First (Recommended for New Users) ⭐

If you haven't created an account yet:

1. **Click "Don't have an account? Sign up"** at the bottom of the login screen
2. Fill out the signup form:
   - Email: Any email (e.g., `yourname@test.com`)
   - Password: Choose a password (e.g., `Test123456`)
   - Name: Your name
   - Select "Keeper" or "Teller"
3. Complete the onboarding
4. ✅ You'll be automatically signed in!

### Option 2: Use Existing Valid Credentials

If you've already created an account:

1. Make sure you're using the **exact same email and password** from signup
2. Check for common mistakes:
   - ❌ Typos in email or password
   - ❌ Caps Lock is on (passwords are case-sensitive)
   - ❌ Extra spaces before or after the email/password
   - ❌ Using `@gmail.com` when you signed up with `@test.com`

## Why This Happens

This is a **normal error** when:
- First-time users try to sign in instead of signing up
- You're testing and trying random credentials
- You forgot which email/password you used during signup
- You cleared your database but are using old credentials

## Quick Test

Try this to verify your authentication is working:

1. Go to the **Sign Up** screen
2. Create a test account:
   - Email: `test@adoras.app`
   - Password: `Test123456`
   - Name: Test User
   - Type: Keeper
3. Complete onboarding
4. Sign out
5. Try to sign in with those same credentials

If this works, your authentication system is **100% functional** ✅

## For Developers: How to Verify Users Exist

### Check Supabase Dashboard

1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to **Authentication > Users**
3. You'll see a list of all users who have signed up
4. If the list is empty, no users exist yet!

### Create Test Users via Supabase Dashboard

You can manually create test users:

1. Go to Authentication > Users
2. Click "Add user"
3. Enter email and password
4. User will be created and you can sign in with those credentials

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Trying to Sign In Before Signing Up
**Solution:** Click "Sign up" instead of "Sign in"

### ❌ Mistake 2: Using Wrong Email
**Solution:** Use the exact email from signup, including `@domain.com`

### ❌ Mistake 3: Using Wrong Password
**Solution:** Passwords are case-sensitive - make sure Caps Lock is off

### ❌ Mistake 4: Browser Autofill Using Old Credentials
**Solution:** Clear the form and type manually

## What's NOT Wrong

✅ Your authentication code is correct
✅ Your Supabase connection is working
✅ Your Edge Function is deployed properly
✅ Your API client is functioning correctly

The only issue is using credentials that don't exist in your database.

## Next Steps

1. **Click "Sign up"** to create a new account
2. Or **use existing credentials** if you've already signed up
3. That's it! The error will go away once you use valid credentials

## Still Having Issues?

If you've verified your credentials are correct and you still can't sign in:

1. Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors
2. Check that your internet connection is stable
3. Try in an incognito/private browser window
4. Clear browser cache and cookies for your app
5. Check Supabase dashboard to confirm the user exists

---

**TL;DR:** This is not a bug - you're trying to sign in with an account that doesn't exist. Either sign up first, or use credentials from an existing account.
