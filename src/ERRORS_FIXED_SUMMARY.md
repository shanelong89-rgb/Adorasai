Failed to load connection requests: Error: Cannot connect to server
```

**Root Cause:**

- Connection request check failing loudly

**Fix Applied:**

- Made it clear this is non-critical (user can check manually in Settings)
- File: `/components/Dashboard.tsx` line 132

**Impact:**
- Error ‚Üí Info message
- No user-facing impact

### 2. ‚úÖ Channel Cleanup Warning
**Error:**
```

**Fix Applied:**
- Increased threshold for memory fetches to 5000ms
- Added specific detection for `memories/` endpoints
- File: `/utils/performanceMonitor.ts` lines 127-131

**Impact:**
