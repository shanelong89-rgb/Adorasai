# 🚀 Push These Changes to GitHub NOW

## What I Fixed

The Vercel deployment failed due to a **dependency conflict between `date-fns` and `react-day-picker`**.

I've fixed it by:
1. ✅ Downgrading `date-fns` from 4.1.0 → 3.6.0 (fully compatible)
2. ✅ Creating complete `package.json` with all dependencies
3. ✅ Adding `.npmrc` for legacy peer dependency resolution
4. ✅ Updating `vite.config.ts` with import aliases
5. ✅ Updated a few import statements
