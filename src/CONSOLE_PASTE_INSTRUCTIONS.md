# ✅ How to Paste Code in Chrome Console

## 🛡️ Chrome Security Warning

When you try to paste code into Chrome console, you'll see:

> ⚠️ Warning: Don't paste code into the DevTools Console that you don't understand...

**This is NORMAL!** Chrome is protecting you from malicious code.

## ✅ How to Allow Pasting

### Step 1: Type This First

In the console, **type** (don't paste):

```
allow pasting
```

Press Enter.

### Step 2: Now You Can Paste

After typing "allow pasting", you can now paste the diagnostic code!

## 🔒 Is This Safe?

**YES!** The code I provided is completely safe. It only:
- Reads your app state from localStorage
- Checks connection status
- Sends a test message to the API
- **Does NOT steal data or harm your computer**

You can review the code before pasting to verify!

## 🚫 EASIER WAY - No Console Needed!

Instead of using the console, just do this:

### ⚡ Quick Fix (No Console)

**BOTH Shane and Allison:**

1. **Log Out**
   - Click Menu (☰)
   - Click "Log Out"

2. **Log Back In**
   - Enter email and password
   - Click "Sign In"

3. **Test Message**

   - Shane: Type "Test 123"
   - Shane: Click Send (→)

## 🔧 If Logging Out Doesn't Work

Then use the console diagnostic:

1. **Open Console:**
   - Press F12 (or Cmd+Option+I on Mac)
   - Click "Console" tab

2. **Type:** `allow pasting` and press Enter

3. **Paste** the diagnostic code

4. **Press Enter** to run

## 📱 Mobile Version (No Console Needed)

**On iPhone/Mobile:**

1. **Hard Refresh:**
   - Pull down on the app twice
   - Let it fully reload

2. **Force Quit and Reopen:**
   - Swipe up to quit app
   - Reopen from home screen

3. **Log Out and Back In:**
   - Menu → Log Out
   - Log back in

---

## 🎯 Recommended: Try Without Console First!

**Skip the console entirely:**

1. ✅ Log out and back in (both users)
2. ✅ Send test message
3. ✅ Check if it works

**Only use console if that fails!**

---

## ⚡ TL;DR

**Chrome wants you to type** `allow pasting` **first.**

**OR just log out/in instead - easier and safer!**
