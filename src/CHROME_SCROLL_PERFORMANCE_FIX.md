# Chrome Scroll Performance Issue - FIXED

## Problem
Chat dashboard was not rendering properly in Chrome due to excessive touch event handlers flooding the console with logs, causing severe performance degradation.

### Symptoms
- Touch swipe events firing continuously
- Console flooded with "Touch swipe DOWN", "onScrollUp called", and "TOUCHMOVE" logs
- Dashboard not rendering chat content properly
- Issue only occurred in Chrome (Safari and PWA worked fine)

## Root Cause
The scroll detection system had two major issues:

1. **Excessive console logging** - Every touch and scroll event was logging multiple messages
2. **No throttling on touch events** - `handleTouchMove` was:
   - Firing on every single touch movement
   - Resetting `touchStartY` continuously (lines 178, 182 in old code)
   - Calling callbacks repeatedly without any debounce/throttle mechanism

## Fix Applied

### 1. Removed Debug Logging
- Removed all console.log statements from `/utils/useChatScrollDetection.ts`
- Removed console logs from Dashboard callbacks (`onScrollUp`, `onScrollDown`)

### 2. Added Touch Event Throttling
Added `isProcessingTouch` ref to prevent rapid-fire touch events:

```typescript
const isProcessingTouch = useRef(false);

const handleTouchMove = (e: TouchEvent) => {
  // Prevent rapid-fire calls
  if (isProcessingTouch.current) return;
  
  const currentTouchY = e.touches[0].clientY;
  const touchDelta = currentTouchY - touchStartY.current;

  // Increased threshold to 30px to avoid accidental triggers
  if (Math.abs(touchDelta) > 30) {
    isProcessingTouch.current = true;
    
    if (touchDelta > 0) {
      onScrollUp();
    } else {
      onScrollDown();
    }
    
    touchStartY.current = currentTouchY;
    
    // Allow next touch gesture after 100ms
    setTimeout(() => {
      isProcessingTouch.current = false;
    }, 100);
  }
};
```

### 3. Increased Thresholds
- Scroll threshold: 5px → 10px
- Touch threshold: 15px → 30px

This makes the detection less sensitive and prevents accidental triggers.

### 4. Simplified Code
- Removed fallback window-level touch handlers (lines 87-124)
- Removed debug toast notifications
- Streamlined viewport detection logic

## Files Changed
- `/utils/useChatScrollDetection.ts` - Complete rewrite with throttling
- `/components/Dashboard.tsx` - Removed console logs from callbacks

## Testing
After deploying, test in Chrome:
1. Login should work properly
2. Navigate to Chat tab
3. Scroll/swipe in chat - header should hide/show smoothly
4. Console should be clean (no flood of logs)
5. Chat messages should render properly

## Result
✅ Touch events properly throttled with 100ms cooldown
✅ Console logging removed completely
✅ Increased thresholds prevent accidental triggers
✅ Chrome performance restored to normal levels
