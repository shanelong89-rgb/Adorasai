## üîç If Still Broken After All That

**Then** we need to debug. But try this first:

### Quick Check (No Console)

**Shane:** After logging in, check these:
1. Do you see Allison's name at the top?
2. Does it say "Online" with green dot?
3. Do you see old messages in chat?

**If NO to any:**
- Connection isn't established
- Need to redo invitation flow
- Check `/QUICK_START_INVITATION.md`

**If YES to all:**
- Connection is good
- Frontend issue
- **Now** use console diagnostics
