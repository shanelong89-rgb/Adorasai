   - Chat with each other
   - Upload photos, videos, voice notes
   - View shared media library
4. Shane has admin privileges:
   - Edit memory metadata (date, location, tags, notes)
   - Delete memories
5. Allison has simplified experience:

   - No edit/delete permissions

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Open Debug Panel?
Run in browser console:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('adoras-debug', 'true');
```
Then refresh and press **Ctrl+Shift+D**

### Shane Not Found?
Make sure Shane is signed up first as a Legacy Keeper at shanelong@gmail.com

### Invitation Code Not Working?
Run the setup again from the Debug Panel Test tab

### Connection Not Showing?
Make sure both Shane and Allison are signed up and Allison used the invitation code during signup

## Next Steps

2. Make sure Shane is signed up
3. Run setup invitation
4. Sign up Allison with the code
5. Verify connection
6. Start testing memory sharing features!
