# Disconnect & Delete Feature - Complete Implementation

## Overview
Users can now **disconnect from connections** and optionally **delete all shared memories**. This provides complete control over data privacy and connection management.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Disconnect from Connections
- End connection relationship with any storyteller/keeper
- Connection status changes to "disconnected"
- Both users lose access to shared connection
- Can reconnect in the future via new connection request

### 2. Optional Memory Deletion
- Choose to keep or delete memories when disconnecting
- Permanent deletion of all shared content:
  - Photos and videos
  - Voice notes and audio
  - Text messages and chats
  - Documents and files
  - All metadata and timestamps

### 3. Safety & Confirmations
- Two-step confirmation process
- Clear warnings about permanence
- Shows count of memories that will be deleted
- Cannot undo disconnection or deletion
- Both users affected by disconnection

## User Interface

### Menu Access
**Hamburger Menu → "Manage Connections"**
- Available for both Keepers and Storytellers
- Shows all active connections
- Displays connection details and stats

### Connection Cards
Each connection displays:
- Partner's name, photo, and relationship
- Email address
- Number of shared memories
- Connection date
- "Disconnect" button

### Disconnect Dialog
When clicking "Disconnect":
1. **Warning Screen** appears:
   - Shows partner name
   - Explains consequences
   - Lists what happens when you disconnect

2. **Delete Memories Option** (checkbox):
   - "Delete all shared memories"
   - Shows exact count (e.g., "37 memories")
   - Additional warning if selected

3. **What Happens** section:
   - Connection removed from both accounts
   - Partner loses access
   - Memories preserved OR deleted (based on choice)
   - Can reconnect in future

4. **Action Buttons**:
   - Cancel (gray)
   - Disconnect (red)
   - Disconnect & Delete (red, if checkbox selected)

## Backend Implementation

### Database Updates

#### Connection Type Updated:
```typescript
{
  status: 'pending' | 'active' | 'declined' | 'disconnected';
  disconnectedAt?: string;
  disconnectedBy?: string; // User ID who initiated
}
```

### New Backend Function: `disconnectConnection()`

**Parameters:**
- `userId`: Current user ID
- `connectionId`: Connection to disconnect
- `deleteMemories`: Boolean (optional, default false)

**Process:**
1. Validates user is part of connection
2. Checks connection isn't already disconnected
3. Updates connection status to 'disconnected'
4. Records timestamp and initiating user
5. Removes connection from both users' lists
6. If deleteMemories=true:
   - Deletes all memory records
   - Clears connection memory list
   - Returns count of deleted items
7. Returns success message

**Security:**
- Only participants can disconnect
- Cannot disconnect already-disconnected connection
- Both users immediately lose access

### API Endpoint

**POST** `/connections/:connectionId/disconnect`

**Headers:**
```
Authorization: Bearer {access_token}
```

**Body:**
```json
{
  "deleteMemories": true  // optional, default false
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Disconnected from Jane Doe and deleted 37 shared memories",
  "deletedMemoriesCount": 37
}
```

## Frontend Components

### 1. ConnectionManagement.tsx
**Main management dialog showing all connections**
- Lists all active connections
- Shows stats for each connection
- Disconnect button for each
- Handles loading and empty states
- Triggers disconnect flow

### 2. DisconnectConfirmDialog.tsx
**Confirmation dialog with options**
- Partner name and photo

2. Clicks "Manage Connections"
3. Sees Mom's connection card (156 memories)
4. Clicks "Disconnect" button
5. Warning dialog appears
6. Sarah **does NOT check** "Delete memories"
7. Reviews "What happens" list
8. Clicks "Disconnect"
9. ✅ Connection ended
10. ✅ 156 memories preserved but inaccessible
11. ✅ Both Sarah and Mom lose access
12. ✅ Can reconnect later if desired

### Example 2: Disconnect With Deletion
**User:** John (Keeper)
**Partner:** Dad (Storyteller)
**Memories:** 42

1. John opens "Manage Connections"
2. Sees Dad's connection (42 memories)
3. Clicks "Disconnect"
4. Warning dialog appears
5. John **CHECKS** "Delete all shared memories"
6. Additional warning appears in red
7. Reads: "Deleting 42 memories is permanent"
8. Clicks "Disconnect & Delete"
9. ✅ Connection ended
10. ✅ All 42 memories permanently deleted
11. ✅ Both John and Dad lose access
12. ✅ No data recovery possible

## Safety Features

### Warnings & Confirmations
✅ Two-step process (button → dialog)
✅ Red destructive theme throughout
✅ Multiple warning messages
✅ Explicit "cannot be undone" text
✅ Shows exact count of memories
✅ Different button text based on choice

### What Users Are Told

**Always Shown:**
- "This action cannot be undone"
- "Partner will also lose access"
- "Connection removed from both accounts"
- "Can send new request in future"

**If Deleting Memories:**
- "Permanently delete all X memories"
- "Includes photos, videos, voice notes, messages"
- "Deletion is permanent and cannot be recovered"
- Warning appears in red with alert icon

### Prevents Accidents
- Cannot accidentally delete memories (checkbox required)
- Cancel button always visible
- Confirmation required after clicking disconnect
- Clear visual hierarchy (cancel = outline, disconnect = destructive)

## Technical Details

### Memory Deletion Process
When `deleteMemories=true`:

1. Get memory list from connection
2. For each memory ID:
   - Delete memory record from KV store
   - Remove from all indexes
3. Clear connection memory list
4. Count deletions for confirmation
5. Return count to user

**Note:** Media files in storage are NOT automatically deleted (requires separate cleanup job)

### Connection Status Flow

```
pending → active → disconnected
            ↓
         declined
```

- `pending`: Invitation sent, waiting
- `active`: Connection established
- `declined`: Invitation rejected
- `disconnected`: Connection ended by user

### Reconnection Process

After disconnecting:
1. Connection marked as 'disconnected'
2. Users can send NEW connection request
3. New connection ID created if accepted
4. Previous connection remains in history (disconnected)
5. Fresh start with new memory list

## API Client Integration

```typescript
// Disconnect without deleting memories
await apiClient.disconnectConnection(connectionId, false);

// Disconnect and delete all memories
await apiClient.disconnectConnection(connectionId, true);
```

## Error Handling

### Backend Errors
- Connection not found
- Unauthorized (not part of connection)
- Already disconnected
- Database errors

### Frontend Errors
- Network failures → Retry prompt
- Timeout → Error toast
- Invalid response → Error log
- User canceled → Silent close

### User Feedback
- Success: Green toast with message
- Error: Red toast with description
- Loading: Spinner with "Disconnecting..."
- Completion: Page reload to refresh

## Privacy Implications

### Data Retention
**Without deletion:**
- Memories remain in database
- Inaccessible to both users
- Could be recovered by support
- Counts toward storage quota

**With deletion:**
- Memories permanently deleted
- Cannot be recovered
- Frees storage space
- Complete data removal

### GDPR Compliance
- Users control their data
- Clear deletion option
- Permanent removal possible
- No hidden retention
