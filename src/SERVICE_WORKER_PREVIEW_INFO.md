# Service Worker & Push Notifications in Preview Environment

## Current Status

‚úÖ **In-App Notifications**: Working perfectly in preview
‚úÖ **Chat Badges**: Working perfectly in preview  
‚úÖ **Realtime Messaging**: Working perfectly in preview
‚è≥ **Service Worker**: Not available in Figma Make preview (expected)
‚è≥ **Push Notifications**: Not available in Figma Make preview (expected)

## Why Service Workers Don't Work in Preview

The Figma Make preview environment (`*.figmaiframepreview.figma.site`) **cannot** serve the `/public/sw.js` file at the root path, which results in a 404 error. This is a limitation of the preview environment's static file serving.

**Error you'll see in preview:**
```
‚ùå [SW] Service worker registration failed: TypeError: Failed to register a ServiceWorker for scope 
('https://...-figmaiframepreview.figma.site/') with script ('.../sw.js'): 
A bad HTTP response code (404) was received when fetching the script.
```

This is **completely expected and normal** for preview environments.

## What Works in Preview

Despite service workers being unavailable, these features work perfectly:

### 1. **In-App Notifications** ‚úÖ
- Toast notifications when messages arrive
- Notification center with unread count
- Badge on chat tab
- Sound effects
- Realtime updates

### 2. **Chat System** ‚úÖ  
- Realtime messaging via Supabase
- Message delivery confirmations
- Typing indicators (if implemented)
- Read receipts

### 3. **Offline Detection** ‚úÖ
- Network status monitoring
- Offline queue for pending actions
- User feedback when offline

## What Will Work in Production

When you deploy Adoras to production (your own domain or hosting), these additional features will activate:

### 1. **Service Worker** ‚úÖ
- Background sync
- Offline caching
- Asset preloading
- PWA functionality

### 2. **Push Notifications** ‚úÖ
- Native iOS/Android notification banners
- Background notifications (even when app is closed)
- Notification actions (Reply, Open, etc.)
- Badge counts on app icon
- Custom vibration patterns
- Rich media in notifications

### 3. **PWA Installation** ‚úÖ
- Add to Home Screen
- Standalone app mode
- Splash screens
- Custom app icon

## How the Code Handles This

The code has been updated to gracefully detect and handle the preview environment:

### 1. **Service Worker Registration** (`/utils/pwaInstaller.ts`)
```typescript
// Checks if /sw.js exists before trying to register
// Logs informative messages when not available
// Returns null gracefully (doesn't break the app)
```

### 2. **Push Notification Subscription** (`/utils/notificationService.ts`)
```typescript
// Detects if service worker is available
// Falls back to in-app notifications if not
// Provides clear console messages about what's happening
```

### 3. **UI Components** (`/components/NotificationSettings.tsx`)
```typescript
// Detects preview environment
// Shows informative alert explaining the limitation
// Confirms push notifications will work in production
```

## Console Messages You'll See

### In Preview (Expected):
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è [SW] Service worker file not accessible (404)
‚ÑπÔ∏è [SW] This is expected in Figma Make preview environment
‚ÑπÔ∏è [SW] Service workers and push notifications will work when deployed to production
‚ÑπÔ∏è [SW] For now, in-app notifications will be used instead
```

### In Production (After Deployment):
```
‚úÖ [SW] Service worker registered successfully!
‚úÖ [SW] Service worker activated and ready!
üì° [SUBSCRIBE] Service worker ready
üì° [SUBSCRIBE] Successfully subscribed to push notifications
```

## Testing Push Notifications

### In Preview:
- ‚úÖ Test in-app notifications (these work!)
- ‚úÖ Test chat badges and unread counts
- ‚úÖ Test notification center
- ‚ùå Cannot test push notifications (not available)

### After Deployment:
1. Deploy to production (Netlify, Vercel, your own hosting)
2. Visit your production URL
3. Enable notifications in settings
4. Send a test message from another account
5. You should receive a native push notification!

## Next Steps

1. **For Development/Testing**:
   - Continue using in-app notifications in preview
   - Everything else works perfectly
   - No action needed

2. **For Production**:
   - Deploy Adoras to your hosting provider
   - The service worker will automatically work
   - Push notifications will activate automatically
   - No code changes needed!

## Summary

Don't worry about the service worker errors in preview - **this is completely normal and expected**. The app has been designed to:

1. Work perfectly in preview with in-app notifications
2. Automatically upgrade to push notifications when deployed
3. Provide clear feedback about what's available in each environment

Your users will get the full push notification experience once you deploy! üéâ
