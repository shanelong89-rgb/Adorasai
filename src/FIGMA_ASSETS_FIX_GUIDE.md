## ❌ NEW ISSUE: Figma Asset Imports

The `figma:asset/` imports only work in Figma Make, not on Vercel.

---

## 🔧 THE FIX

I've already fixed all 4 files locally:
1. ✅ `WelcomeScreen.tsx` - Removed figma asset imports, used SVG logo + Unsplash background
2. ✅ `Dashboard.tsx` - Removed figma asset import
3. ✅ `SignUpInitialScreen.tsx` - Removed figma asset import
4. ✅ `UserTypeSelection.tsx` - Removed figma asset import

---

## 📋 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO

Copy these 4 updated files to your GitHub repo:

### **File 1: WelcomeScreen.tsx**
Location: `/components/WelcomeScreen.tsx`
- Replaced Adoras logo image with clean SVG
- Replaced plant leaf image with Unsplash URL
- Removed all `figma:asset/` imports

### **File 2: Dashboard.tsx**
Location: `/components/Dashboard.tsx`
- Removed unused `adorasLogo` import
- No visual changes (logo wasn't being used)

### **File 3: SignUpInitialScreen.tsx**
Location: `/components/SignUpInitialScreen.tsx`
- Removed unused image import
- No visual changes (image wasn't being used)

### **File 4: UserTypeSelection.tsx**
Location: `/components/UserTypeSelection.tsx`
- Removed unused image import
- No visual changes (image wasn't being used)

## ⚡ QUICK FIX (2 Options)

### **OPTION 1: Manual GitHub Edit (5 minutes)**

For each file:
1. Copy the file content from Figma Make
2. Go to GitHub: `https://github.com/shanelong89-rgb/Adorasai/blob/main/components/[FILE].tsx`
3. Click ✏️
4. Replace all content
5. Commit

### **OPTION 2: Use Git Commands (1 minute if you have git setup)**

If you have git installed locally:
```bash
git pull
# Copy the 4 files from Figma Make to your local repo
git add components/WelcomeScreen.tsx
git add components/Dashboard.tsx
git add components/SignUpInitialScreen.tsx
git add components/UserTypeSelection.tsx
git commit -m "Fix: Remove figma:asset imports for production build"
git push
```

- `UPDATED_WelcomeScreen.txt` - Copy to GitHub WelcomeScreen.tsx
- `UPDATED_Dashboard.txt` - Copy to GitHub Dashboard.tsx
