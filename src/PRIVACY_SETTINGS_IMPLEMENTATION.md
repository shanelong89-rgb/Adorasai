# Privacy & Security Settings - Implementation Complete

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Updated Database Schema (`/supabase/functions/server/database.tsx`)
- Added `privacySettings` object to `UserProfile` interface:
  ```typescript
  privacySettings?: {
    privateProfile?: boolean; // Only invited people can see memories
    shareLocationData?: boolean; // Include location in memories
  };
  ```

#### 2. New Auth Functions (`/supabase/functions/server/auth.tsx`)
Added three new security functions:

**a) `changePassword(userId, currentPassword, newPassword)`**
- Verifies current password before changing
- Updates password using Supabase Admin API
- Returns success/error status

**b) `exportUserData(userId)`**
- GDPR-compliant data export
- Exports user profile, connections, and all memories
- Returns JSON data for download

**c) `deleteUserAccount(userId, password)`**
- Requires password verification
- Deletes all user data:
  - User profile
  - All memories
  - All connections
  - Auth user account
- Permanent deletion with no recovery

#### 3. New API Routes (`/supabase/functions/server/index.tsx`)
- `POST /make-server-deded1eb/auth/change-password` - Change password
- `GET /make-server-deded1eb/auth/export-data` - Export user data
- `POST /make-server-deded1eb/auth/delete-account` - Delete account

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. API Client (`/utils/api/client.ts`)
Added three new methods:
- `changePassword(currentPassword, newPassword)`
- `exportUserData()`
- `deleteAccount(password)`

#### 2. User Profile Type (`/App.tsx`)
Updated `UserProfile` interface to include `privacySettings`

#### 3. Privacy & Security Component (`/components/PrivacySecurity.tsx`)
**Complete rewrite with working functionality:**

**Privacy Settings (Auto-save):**
- ‚úÖ Private Profile toggle - Controls visibility of memories
- ‚úÖ Share Location Data toggle - Controls location metadata

**Security Features:**
- ‚úÖ Change Password dialog with validation
  - Current password verification
  - New password confirmation
  - Minimum 6 character requirement
  
- ‚úÖ Download My Data button
  - Exports all user data as JSON
  - GDPR compliant
  - Includes profile, connections, and memories

**Danger Zone:**
- ‚úÖ Delete Account feature
  - Password verification required
  - Shows what will be deleted
  - Permanent deletion warning
  - Automatically logs out after deletion

**Additional Features:**
- Real-time privacy settings sync
- Toast notifications for all actions
- Loading states for async operations
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Privacy policy information

#### 4. Dashboard Integration (`/components/Dashboard.tsx`)
Updated `PrivacySecurity` component props to include:
- `userProfile` - Current user profile
- `onUpdateProfile` - Function to update profile
- `onLogout` - Sign out function

## How It Works

### Privacy Settings
1. User toggles a privacy setting
2. Setting is saved locally (immediate UI update)
3. Setting is saved to backend via `onUpdateProfile`
4. Toast confirmation shown to user

### Change Password
1. User opens Change Password dialog
2. Enters current password, new password (2x)
3. Frontend validates input
4. Backend verifies current password via Supabase auth
5. Backend updates password using Admin API
6. User is notified of success/failure

### Download Data
1. User clicks "Download My Data"
2. Backend fetches all user data from KV store
3. Data is compiled into JSON format
4. Frontend creates downloadable blob
5. Browser downloads file: `adoras-data-export-YYYY-MM-DD.json`

### Delete Account
1. User clicks "Delete Account"
2. Confirmation dialog shows what will be deleted
3. User enters password to confirm
4. Backend verifies password
5. Backend deletes all data:
   - All memories associated with user
   - All connections
   - User profile
   - Auth account
6. User is logged out automatically

## Server Status Note

The server may show a timeout during initial cold start. This is normal for Deno Deploy edge functions that haven't been accessed recently. 

**Debug logs added:**
- `üìù Auth module loading...` - Auth module import started
- `‚úÖ Auth module loaded successfully` - Auth module ready
- `üöÄ Adoras Server initialized successfully` - All modules loaded
- `‚úÖ All routes registered` - Routes are ready
- `üì° Server is ready to accept requests` - Server is live

If you see a timeout, wait 30 seconds and try again. The server will warm up after the first request.

## Testing

7. Log out and log back in with new password

### Test Download Data:
1. Click "Download My Data"
2. Verify file downloads
