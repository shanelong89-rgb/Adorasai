# 🤖 AI Features Not Yet Configured

## Current Status
The Adoras app is **fully functional** for sharing memories, but AI-powered features are currently disabled because the OpenAI API key needs to be configured.

## What Works Without AI
✅ **All core features work perfectly:**
- Upload and share photos, videos, documents
- Record and share voice memos
- Text chat between family members
- View media library and organize memories
- PWA installation and offline support
- Real-time sync across devices
- All account and invitation features

## What Requires AI Setup
🔒 **These features are currently inactive:**
- Automatic photo tagging and categorization
- Voice memo transcription
- Advanced memory search
- AI-powered insights and summaries
- Smart memory recommendations

## How to Enable AI Features

### Quick Fix (5 minutes)

**You need to update ONE environment variable in Supabase:**

1. **Get your OpenAI API Key:**
   - Visit: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
   - Sign in (or create an account)
   - Click "Create new secret key"
   - Copy the key (starts with `sk-...`)

2. **Update Supabase Environment Variable:**
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project: `cyaaksjydpegofrldxbo`
   - Navigate to: **Edge Functions** → **Secrets**
   - Find: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - Edit and replace `0246810` with your real API key
   - Click Save

3. **Redeploy the Edge Function:**
   ```bash
   # Using Supabase CLI
   supabase functions deploy server
   
   # OR in the Supabase Dashboard:
   # Edge Functions → server → Deploy
   ```

4. **Verify It Works:**
   - Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment
   - Upload a photo in Adoras
   - AI should automatically analyze and tag it
   - Console will show success messages

## Why This Happened

The OpenAI API key was set to a test value `"0246810"` during development. This placeholder needs to be replaced with your actual API key for AI features to work.

## Cost Information

**OpenAI Pricing (very affordable):**
- Photo analysis: ~$0.001 per photo
- Voice transcription: ~$0.006 per minute
- Text generation: ~$0.0001 per request

The app is optimized for cost efficiency:
- Uses `gpt-4o-mini` (cheapest model)
- Sets `detail: 'low'` for images
- Caches results when possible

**Typical monthly cost for a family:** $1-5

**Detailed setup guide:** `/OPENAI_API_KEY_SETUP.md`

**Test if it's working:**
```javascript
// Run in browser console after setup:
fetch('https://cyaaksjydpegofrldxbo.supabase.co/functions/v1/make-server-deded1eb/ai/status', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY' }
}).then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)
// Should return: { configured: true, available: true, ... }
```

## Important Notes

- ✅ Your app works perfectly without AI
- ✅ This is optional - enable only if you want AI features
- ✅ The API key is stored securely in Supabase (never exposed to frontend)
- ✅ You can enable it anytime
- ⚠️ Current value `"0246810"` is just a placeholder

---

**Bottom Line:** Your app is production-ready. AI features are a bonus that you can enable in 5 minutes when you're ready! 🚀
