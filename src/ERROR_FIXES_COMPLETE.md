# Error Fixes Complete

## Fixed Errors

### 1. ✅ Video Playback Error (NotSupportedError)
**Error:** `NotSupportedError: The element has no supported sources`

**Root Cause:** Video elements were attempting to play without proper error handling, causing unhandled promise rejections when:
- Video URLs were invalid or expired
- Video sources were not yet loaded
- Video formats were not supported

**Fix Applied:**
- Added comprehensive error handling to `handleVideoClick()` in ChatTab.tsx
- Added `onError` handlers to all video elements in both ChatTab.tsx and MediaLibraryTab.tsx
- Added source validation before attempting to play videos
- Added user-friendly toast notifications for different error types:
  - NotSupportedError: "Video format not supported or source unavailable"
  - NotAllowedError: "Video playback requires user interaction"
  - Generic errors: "Failed to play video"

**Files Modified:**
- `/components/ChatTab.tsx` - Added error handling to video playback
- `/components/MediaLibraryTab.tsx` - Added error handlers to video elements

### 2. ✅ Search Functionality Enhancement
**Improvement:** Made search fully functional across all memory fields

**Enhancement Applied:**
- Search now covers:
  - Content, tags, dates (original)
  - Notes, prompt questions
  - Photo locations, detected people
  - Video locations, video people
  - Voice transcripts, translations, languages
  - Document scanned text, file names
  - General location, category
- Added clear button (X icon) to search input
- Optimized search logic for better performance

**Files Modified:**
- `/components/MediaLibraryTab.tsx` - Enhanced filtering logic and added clear button

## Expected Warnings (Not Errors)

### ⚠️ Cold Start Performance
**Message:** `Slow operation detected: resource-fetch took 5371ms (cold start - expected)`

**Status:** This is NORMAL and EXPECTED behavior
- Supabase Edge Functions have a cold start delay after inactivity
- This is standard serverless architecture behavior
- No fix needed - this is by design

### ⚠️ OpenAI Quota Exceeded
**Messages:**
- `OpenAI quota exceeded - document extraction unavailable`
- `AI document extraction error (non-JSON): 503`
- `OpenAI Vision API error: insufficient_quota`

**Status:** This is HANDLED GRACEFULLY
- The app already has comprehensive error handling for quota issues
- Users receive helpful fallback messages:
  - "You can manually add text content to your memory using the edit button"
- The app continues to function normally - users can manually add:
  - Document text
  - Photo tags
  - Photo metadata
- To restore automated AI features, add credits at: https://platform.openai.com/account/billing

**No Code Changes Needed:** This is working as designed with proper fallbacks

## Summary

✅ **Critical Error Fixed:** Video playback errors eliminated with comprehensive error handling
✅ **Enhancement Complete:** Search functionality now covers all memory fields
⚠️ **Expected Behaviors:** Cold start delays and OpenAI quota warnings are normal and handled

The app is now more robust and provides better user feedback when errors occur.
