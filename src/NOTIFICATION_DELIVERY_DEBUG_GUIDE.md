# Notification Delivery Debug Guide üîî

## Current Issue

**Working:** Browser (Allison) ‚Üí Mobile (Shane) ‚úÖ
**NOT Working:** Browser (Other account?) ‚Üí Mobile (Shane) ‚ùå

## Root Cause Analysis

After reviewing the codebase, **I found that there's NO automatic notification sending when messages are created**. 

### The Problem:
1. ‚úÖ Frontend has notification service (`/utils/notificationService.ts`)
2. ‚úÖ Backend has notification API (`/supabase/functions/server/notifications.tsx`)
3. ‚ùå **BUT: No code connects them when messages are sent!**

The backend creates memories but **never triggers notifications to the recipient**.

## Why It Might Seem to Work Sometimes

If notifications appear to work in one case but not another, it could be:

1. **In-App Notifications Only** - The app shows toast/in-app notifications for messages received while the app is open, but doesn't send push notifications
2. **Manual Testing** - Someone manually triggered a test notification
3. **Real-time Presence** - Real-time indicators update, but no actual notifications are sent

## The Fix Needed

We need to add notification sending logic to the memory creation flow.
