# ✅ Signup 401 Error Fixed

## 🐛 Problem

**Error:**
```
❌ API Error [/auth/signup]: {
  "code": 401,
  "message": "Missing authorization header"
}
```

**Root Cause:**
- The signup endpoint was being called WITHOUT an Authorization header
- Supabase Edge Functions require an Authorization header even for public endpoints
- For unauthenticated endpoints (like signup), we need to send the **public anon key**
- For authenticated endpoints, we send the **user's access token**

## ✅ Solution

**File Modified:** `/utils/api/client.ts`

### Change 1: Updated `request()` Method

**Added `requiresAuth` parameter:**
```typescript
private async request<T>(
  endpoint: string,
  options: RequestInit = {},
  requiresAuth: boolean = true // New parameter
): Promise<T>
```

**Logic:**
- If user has access token → Use it (authenticated request)
- If no token BUT endpoint is public → Use public anon key
- If no token AND endpoint requires auth → No Authorization header (will fail)

**Code:**
```typescript
// For endpoints that don't require auth (like signup), use the public anon key
// For authenticated endpoints, use the user's access token
if (token && token !== 'undefined' && token !== 'null') {
  headers['Authorization'] = `Bearer ${token}`;
} else if (!requiresAuth) {
  // For public endpoints (signup), use the public anon key for Supabase edge functions
  headers['Authorization'] = `Bearer ${publicAnonKey}`;
}
```

### Change 2: Updated `signup()` Method

**Pass `requiresAuth: false`:**
```typescript
async signup(data: SignupRequest): Promise<SignupResponse> {
  const response = await this.request<SignupResponse>(
    '/auth/signup',
    {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify(data),
    },
    false // Signup doesn't require authentication ← NEW!
  );

  return response;
}
```

## 🔄 Request Flow (Before Fix)

```
User clicks "Sign Up"
    ↓
Frontend calls apiClient.signup()
    ↓
request() method called
    ↓
No access token (user is new)
    ↓
No Authorization header added ❌
    ↓
Request sent to Supabase Edge Function
    ↓
Supabase rejects: "Missing authorization header"
    ↓
401 Error returned
```

---

## ✅ Request Flow (After Fix)

```
User clicks "Sign Up"
    ↓
Frontend calls apiClient.signup()
    ↓
request() method called with requiresAuth: false
    ↓
No access token (user is new)
    ↓
BUT requiresAuth is false!
    ↓
Add Authorization: Bearer ${publicAnonKey} ✅
    ↓
Request sent to Supabase Edge Function
    ↓
Supabase accepts (valid anon key)
    ↓
User created successfully! 🎉
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test 1: New User Signup

**Steps:**
1. Open Adoras in incognito/private window
2. Click "Get Started"
3. Select user type (Keeper or Teller)
4. Fill in signup form
5. Click "Create Account"

**Expected:**
- ✅ No 401 error
- ✅ User account created
- ✅ Automatically signed in
- ✅ Redirected to dashboard

**Before fix:**
- ❌ 401 error: "Missing authorization header"
- ❌ Signup fails
- ❌ User stuck on signup screen

---

### Test 2: Check Console Logs

**Open browser console (F12) during signup:**

**Before fix:**
```
❌ API Error [/auth/signup]: {"code": 401, "message": "Missing authorization header"}
❌ Headers sent: {"Authorization": "NONE"}
```

**After fix:**
```
🌐 API Request: POST https://...supabase.co/.../auth/signup
📡 API Response Status: 200 OK
✅ User created successfully
```

---

## 📋 Impact

### What This Fixes

✅ **New user signup** - Users can now create accounts
✅ **Shane and Allison signup** - Can both create accounts without errors
✅ **All new users** - Anyone can sign up going forward

### Other Public Endpoints

**These endpoints also don't require auth:**
- `/auth/signup` ← FIXED!
- `/health` (already works - doesn't need auth)

**These endpoints DO require auth:**
- `/auth/signin` (requires token after first login)
- `/memories/*` (requires user token)
- `/connections/*` (requires user token)
- `/invitations/*` (requires user token)

## 🔒 Security

### Public Anon Key vs Access Token

**Public Anon Key (`publicAnonKey`):**
- Safe to expose in frontend
- Used for public/unauthenticated requests
- Limited permissions (can't access user data)
- Rate limited by Supabase
- Used for: signup, health checks

**Access Token (user's JWT):**
- Unique per user session
- Used for authenticated requests
- Full access to user's own data
- Expires after time period
- Used for: memories, profile, connections

### Why This Is Safe

**Before:**
- No authorization → Rejected by Supabase ❌

**After:**
- Public anon key → Accepted by Supabase ✅
- Still can't access other users' data
- Still rate limited
- Still secure

**The anon key is meant for this use case!**

## 🎯 For Shane & Allison

### What Changed

**Before:**
- Sign up button clicked → 401 error → Can't create account ❌

**After:**
- Sign up button clicked → Account created → Auto logged in → Dashboard ✅

### How to Test

**Shane (iPhone):**
1. Open Adoras link from Allison
2. Click "Get Started"
3. Select "I'm a Storyteller"
4. Fill in your info
5. Click "Create Account"
6. **Should work now!** ✅

**Allison (Computer):**
1. Open Adoras
2. Click "Get Started"
3. Select "I'm a Legacy Keeper"
4. Fill in your info
5. Click "Create Account"
6. **Should work now!** ✅

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Supabase Edge Functions

**All Supabase Edge Functions require an Authorization header.**

**Two types:**
1. **User JWT Token** - For authenticated requests
2. **Public Anon Key** - For public requests

**Without either:**
- Supabase returns 401 "Missing authorization header"

**Our fix:**
- Signup uses public anon key (correct! ✅)
- Other endpoints use user token (correct! ✅)

### Why This Wasn't Caught Earlier

**Development vs Production:**
- Local dev might have different auth requirements
- Supabase Edge Functions enforce stricter auth
- Frontend was working, backend was deployed
- Error only appeared when trying to signup through deployed app

**Now fixed for production!** ✅
