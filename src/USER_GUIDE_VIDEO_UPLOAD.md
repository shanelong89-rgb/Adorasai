## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why does my iPhone video need conversion?**  
A: iPhones save videos in .MOV format which doesn't work in Chrome, Firefox, and many other browsers. Converting ensures everyone can view your memories.

**Q: Will conversion reduce video quality?**  
A: No! The conversion maintains the same quality. You won't notice any difference.

**Q: How long does conversion take?**  
A: Usually 30-90 seconds for a 1-minute video. Longer videos take more time.

**Q: Can I upload while conversion happens?**  
A: Yes! The conversion happens in the background. You can continue using the app.

**Q: What if conversion fails?**  
A: The original video is uploaded as a fallback. You can try re-uploading or converting externally first.

**Q: Does conversion use my data plan?**  
A: Conversion happens on your device before upload, so it doesn't use extra data. Only the upload uses data.

**Q: Can I cancel a conversion?**  
A: Not currently. If you close the browser, the conversion will stop and won't upload.

A: No limit on count, but each video must be under 50MB.
