# Notification Spam & Deleted Messages Fix ‚úÖ

## Problem
The app was showing:
1. **Random "deleted message" notifications** - Old deleted messages reappearing
2. **Spam notifications** - Multiple notifications for the same message
3. **Prompt notifications appearing randomly** - Old prompts triggering notifications

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Memory Count Comparison
The notification system in `Dashboard.tsx` was using a simple count comparison:
```typescript
if (validatedMemories.length > prevMemoryCountRef.current)
```

This triggered notifications whenever the count increased, which happened during:
- **Initial load** - Old messages from days ago would trigger notifications
- **Connection switching** - Loading cached memories would re-trigger notifications
- **Periodic refresh** - Reloading all memories would trigger notifications for old messages
- **Deleted message restoration** - If a deleted message was accidentally re-added

### Issue 2: No Timestamp Validation
The system didn't check if a message was actually NEW (created recently) vs just newly loaded from cache.

### Issue 3: No Duplicate Protection
Messages could trigger multiple notifications as they moved through different state updates.

### Issue 4: No Throttling
Rapid state updates could cause notification spam.

## The Fix

### 1. **ID-Based Change Detection** (Dashboard.tsx)
Changed from count-based to ID-based change detection:

```typescript
// Before: Count-based (WRONG)
const prevMemoryCountRef = useRef(validatedMemories.length);

// After: ID-based (CORRECT)
const prevMemoryIdsRef = useRef<Set<string>>(new Set());

// Find NEW memories that weren't in the previous set
const newMemories = validatedMemories.filter(m => 
  !prevMemoryIdsRef.current.has(m.id) &&
  // Only messages from last 10 seconds
  m.timestamp.getTime() > (Date.now() - 10000)
);
```

**Benefits:**
- Only detects truly NEW messages (not seen before)
- Ignores old messages loaded from cache
- Prevents deleted messages from re-triggering notifications

### 2. **Timestamp Validation**
Added 10-second freshness check:
```typescript
m.timestamp.getTime() > (Date.now() - 10000)
```

**Benefits:**
- Messages older than 10 seconds are ignored
- Prevents initial load notifications
- Prevents cached message notifications

### 3. **Notification Throttling**
Added 1-second throttle between notifications:
```typescript
const lastNotificationTimeRef = useRef<number>(Date.now());

if (now - lastNotificationTimeRef.current < 1000) {
  console.log('‚è±Ô∏è Throttling notification - too soon');
  return;
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Max 1 notification per second
- Prevents spam during rapid updates
- Smoother user experience

### 4. **Early Return Guards**
Added validation checks before showing notifications:
```typescript
// Skip if from self
if (newMemory.sender === userType) return;

// Skip if not text/voice
if (newMemory.type !== 'text' && newMemory.type !== 'voice') return;

// Skip if throttled
if (now - lastNotificationTimeRef.current < 1000) return;
```

### 5. **Duplicate Prevention in AppContent**
Added duplicate checks in realtime sync:
```typescript
// Prevent duplicates in global array
if (prev.some(m => m.id === newMemory.id)) {
  console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è Already exists, skipping');
  return prev;
}

// Prevent duplicates in per-connection cache
const existing = prev[connectionId] || [];
if (existing.some(m => m.id === newMemory.id)) {
  console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è Already exists in cache, skipping');
  return prev;
}
```

### 6. **Removed Duplicate Toast Notification**
Removed the `toast.info()` call from AppContent realtime sync since Dashboard already handles notifications. This prevented double notifications.

### 7. **Enhanced Logging**
Added comprehensive logging to track:
- New memory detection
- Notification throttling
- Duplicate prevention
- Memory deletions

## Files Modified
- `/components/Dashboard.tsx` - Fixed notification detection logic
- `/components/AppContent.tsx` - Added duplicate prevention and logging

## Testing Scenarios

### ‚úÖ Scenario 1: Initial Load
**Before:** 50 old messages trigger 50 notifications
**After:** No notifications (all messages older than 10 seconds)

### ‚úÖ Scenario 2: Connection Switch
**Before:** Cached messages trigger notifications
**After:** No notifications (messages already in prevMemoryIdsRef)

### ‚úÖ Scenario 3: Periodic Refresh
**Before:** Reloaded messages trigger notifications
**After:** No notifications (messages already seen)

### ‚úÖ Scenario 4: New Message Arrives
**Before:** Works correctly
**After:** Still works, but with better logging and throttling

### ‚úÖ Scenario 5: Deleted Message
**Before:** If accidentally re-added, triggers notification
**After:** If re-added and old, no notification (timestamp check)

### ‚úÖ Scenario 6: Rapid Messages
**Before:** 5 messages in 1 second = 5 notifications (spam)
**After:** 5 messages in 1 second = max 1 notification per second

## Debug Logs to Monitor

### Successful New Message:
```
üÜï Detected truly NEW memory: {id, type, sender, timestamp, age: 234ms}
‚úÖ Set active prompt for teller: <question>
üîî Showing notification: Alice sent you a prompt - ...
```

### Correctly Ignored Old Message:
```
üîî Notification check for connection conn_123: {
  totalMemories: 45,
  lastReadTimestamp: ...,
  unreadCount: 0,
  (no new memories detected)
}
```

### Throttled Notification:
```
‚è±Ô∏è Throttling notification - too soon after last notification
```

### Duplicate Prevention:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Memory abc123 already exists in global array, skipping
‚ö†Ô∏è Memory abc123 already exists in connection cache, skipping
```

## Impact
- ‚úÖ No more spam notifications
- ‚úÖ No more "deleted message" notifications
- ‚úÖ No more random prompt notifications
- ‚úÖ Clean, fresh notifications only for truly new messages
- ‚úÖ Better performance (less state updates)
- ‚úÖ Better debugging with comprehensive logs
