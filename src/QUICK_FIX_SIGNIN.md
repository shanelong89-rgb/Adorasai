## ✅ What I Fixed

I improved the error messages so they're more helpful:

Invalid email or password. If you don't have an account yet, 
please sign up first by clicking "Create New Account" below.
```

This makes it crystal clear what the issue is and how to fix it!

## 🔍 Why This Happens

The authentication system is working **correctly**. It's supposed to reject sign-in attempts when:
- ❌ The account doesn't exist (hasn't signed up)
- ❌ The password is wrong
- ❌ The email is mistyped

This is **good security** - it prevents unauthorized access.
