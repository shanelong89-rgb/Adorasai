# ✅ Twilio SMS Integration - Setup Your New Account

**Date:** December 28, 2024

## 🎉 Great News!

The Twilio SMS integration is **already fully implemented** in your Adoras app! All you need to do is add your new Twilio credentials and SMS invitations will start working immediately.

## 📋 What You Need from Twilio

After signing up for Twilio, you need to get 3 pieces of information:

### 1. Account SID
- Location: Twilio Console Dashboard (https://console.twilio.com)
- Format: Starts with "AC" followed by 32 characters
- Example: `AC1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef`

### 2. Auth Token
- Location: Twilio Console Dashboard
- Click the eye icon to reveal it
- Format: 32 character string
- Example: `1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef`

### 3. Phone Number
- Get a number: Go to Phone Numbers → Manage → Buy a number
- Or use trial number if testing
- Format: E.164 format with country code
- Example: `+15551234567` (US number)
- Example: `+447911123456` (UK number)

## 🔧 How to Add Your Credentials

You have **TWO options** to add your Twilio credentials:

### Option A: Using Figma Make (Easiest)

I can trigger the credential upload dialogs for you right now:

1. I'll call the `create_supabase_secret` tool for each credential
2. Modal dialogs will appear in your browser
3. Simply paste your Twilio values into each modal
4. That's it! SMS will start working immediately.

### Option B: Manual Setup (Direct in Supabase)

1. Open your Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to: Project Settings → Edge Functions → Secrets
3. Find these three environment variables:
   - `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`
   - `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`
   - `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`
4. Click each one and paste your Twilio values
5. Save changes

## 📱 Phone Number Formatting

**IMPORTANT:** Phone numbers must be in E.164 format (international format):

✅ **Correct formats:**
- `+15551234567` (US)
- `+447911123456` (UK)
- `+33612345678` (France)
- `+61412345678` (Australia)
- `+8613800138000` (China)

❌ **Wrong formats:**
- `5551234567` (missing country code +1)
- `(555) 123-4567` (has formatting)
- `+1 555-123-4567` (has spaces)
- `001-555-1234567` (wrong prefix)

## 🎯 What Happens After Setup

Once your credentials are added, here's the SMS flow:

### When a Legacy Keeper sends an invitation:

1. **They fill out the form:**
   - Partner name (e.g., "Mom")
   - Relationship (e.g., "Mother")
   - Phone number (e.g., "+15551234567")

2. **Backend creates invitation:**
   - Generates unique 6-character code (e.g., "ADR-XK2P9")
   - Stores invitation in database
   - Expires in 7 days

3. **Twilio sends SMS:**
   ```
   [Keeper Name] invited you to share memories on Adoras! 📸

   Your code: ADR-XK2P9

   Download: https://whole-works-409347.framer.app/
   ```

4. **Storyteller receives SMS:**
   - Opens Adoras app
   - Enters the 6-character code
   - Connection is established!

## 🧪 Testing Your Integration

### Test with a Real Phone Number:

1. Create an invitation in your app
2. Use your own phone number (with country code)
3. You should receive an SMS within seconds
4. Check the code matches what's shown in the app

### Check Server Logs:

Look for these messages:
- ✅ `"✅ SMS sent successfully"` → Working perfectly!
- ⚠️ `"⚠️ Twilio credentials not configured"` → Credentials not added yet
- ⚠️ `"⚠️ Invalid Twilio Account SID format"` → Check Account SID format
- ❌ `"❌ Twilio API error"` → Check credentials are correct

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: SMS not received

**Check 1:** Verify credentials are correct
- Account SID starts with "AC" and is 34 characters
- Auth Token is correct (not expired)
- Phone number is in E.164 format

**Check 2:** Check trial account restrictions
- If using trial account, recipient number must be verified
- Verify at: Twilio Console → Phone Numbers → Verified Caller IDs

**Check 3:** Check phone number format
- Must include country code (e.g., +1 for US)
- No spaces, dashes, or parentheses
- Format: `+[country code][number]`

**Check 4:** Check server logs
- Look for Twilio error messages
- Common errors explained below

### Common Twilio Error Codes:

| Error Code | Meaning | Solution |
|------------|---------|----------|
| 20003 | Authentication Error | Check Account SID and Auth Token are correct |
| 21608 | "From" number not valid | Check TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER is correct |
| 21211 | Invalid "To" number | Check recipient number format or verify number (trial) |
| 21610 | Message blocked | Recipient has opted out or number is landline |
| 63016 | Cannot route to number | Number doesn't exist or is invalid |

### Problem: Invitation works but SMS doesn't send

This is actually **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR** if SMS fails! The app is designed to:
- ✅ Always create the invitation successfully
- ✅ Always show the code to the user
- ✅ Allow manual sharing via copy/paste
- ⚠️ Gracefully handle SMS failures

The user can still complete the invitation by manually sharing the code!

## ✅ Current Implementation Status

What's already working in your app:

✅ **Backend:**
- SMS sending function implemented
- Twilio API integration complete
- Error handling with graceful degradation
- Invitation management system
- Phone number validation

✅ **Frontend:**
- Invitation dialog with phone number input
- Success/error messaging
- Manual code sharing fallback
- Connection request system

✅ **Features:**

- One-time use only
- E.164 phone validation
