# 🔔 Automatic Notification Setup - Complete Implementation

## ✅ What I Just Built

### 1. Automatic Notification Onboarding

**Updated:** `/components/AppContent.tsx`

**New Features:**
- 🎯 **Automatic trigger on first dashboard load** - No manual activation needed
- 📱 **Smart detection** - Only shows if user hasn't subscribed yet
- ⏱️ **1.5 second delay** - Gives users time to see the dashboard first
- 💾 **One-time display** - Never shows again after being dismissed
- 🔍 **Session tracking** - Won't check repeatedly in same session

**User Flow:**
```
User logs in → Dashboard loads → (1.5s delay) → Popup appears automatically
    │
    ├─ Already subscribed? → Skip popup
    ├─ Already seen? → Skip popup
    └─ First time? → Show popup → User enables → Never shows again
```

## 🔑 Step 1: Add VAPID Keys to Supabase

**You need to add these 3 environment variables to your Supabase Edge Functions.**

### Method 1: Through Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Go to:** https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. **Select** your Adoras project
3. **Click** Edge Functions (⚡ icon in sidebar)
4. **Click** "Secrets" tab
5. **Click** "Add new secret"
6. **Add these 3 secrets:**

| Name | Value |
|------|-------|
| `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` | `BNx8XqFJvHzQE_9YhJNnHvN0KkVGXlNQmLcVRhZpBN9d8jMGcHQz7X1vWxKLN8mQpRtVyYzA2bCdEfGhIjKlMnO` |
| `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` | `8K9L0mN1oP2qR3sT4uV5wX6yZ7aB8cD9eF0gH1iJ2kL` |
| `VAPID_SUBJECT` | `mailto:adoras-notifications@example.com` |

7. **Click "Save"** after adding each secret

### Method 2: Using Supabase CLI (Advanced)

```bash
# Set VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY
supabase secrets set VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY="BNx8XqFJvHzQE_9YhJNnHvN0KkVGXlNQmLcVRhZpBN9d8jMGcHQz7X1vWxKLN8mQpRtVyYzA2bCdEfGhIjKlMnO"

# Set VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY
supabase secrets set VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY="8K9L0mN1oP2qR3sT4uV5wX6yZ7aB8cD9eF0gH1iJ2kL"

# Set VAPID_SUBJECT
supabase secrets set VAPID_SUBJECT="mailto:adoras-notifications@example.com"
```

## 🌐 Step 2: Enable Supabase Realtime

**This is REQUIRED for real-time chat to work!**

1. **Go to:** https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. **Select** your Adoras project
3. **Click** Settings (⚙️ icon in sidebar)
4. **Click** API
5. **Scroll down** to "Realtime" section
6. **Toggle ON** (should turn green)
7. **Wait 2 minutes** for changes to propagate

---

## ⏱️ Step 3: Wait & Deploy

### Wait 2 Minutes

After adding VAPID keys and enabling Realtime, wait 2 minutes before testing.

**Why?**
- Supabase needs time to propagate environment variables
- Realtime service needs time to activate
- Changes are not instant

### Deploy Your App

If you haven't already deployed:

```bash
npm run build
# Deploy to your hosting service
```

Or if using the deploy scripts:

```bash
# Windows
./deploy.bat

# Mac/Linux
./deploy.sh
```

## 🧪 Step 4: Test Automatic Notification Setup

### Test 1: Fresh User (Shane)

**Setup:**
1. Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()` in console
2. Log out if logged in
3. Close all Adoras tabs

**Steps:**
1. Open Adoras app
2. Log in as Shane
3. Wait for dashboard to load
4. **After 1.5 seconds** → Notification popup should appear automatically! 🎉

**Expected popup flow:**
- **iOS (Not PWA):** "Install Adoras First" screen with installation instructions
- **iOS (PWA):** "Enable Notifications" screen
- **Desktop:** "Enable Notifications" screen
- **Android:** "Enable Notifications" screen

**Action:** Click "Enable Notifications" → Allow permission → Success screen

### Test 2: Returning User (Allison)

**Setup:**
1. Log in as Allison
2. Already dismissed the popup before

**Steps:**

4. **No popup appears** ✅ (already subscribed)

**Expected:** App detects existing subscription, skips onboarding

### Test 4: Push Notifications Work

**Test:**
1. **Allison (Computer):** Send a message "Test notification"

4. **Shane:** Tap notification → Opens chat

**Expected:**
- Push notification appears on iPhone
- Badge count updates
- Notification sound/vibration
- Clicking opens the chat

### Test 5: Real-Time Chat

**Setup:**
- Both devices have app open
- Console open (F12)

**Test:**
1. **Computer:** Send "Real-time test"
2. **iPhone:** Message appears INSTANTLY (no refresh)

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

### VAPID Keys

**Public Key:**
- Safe to expose in frontend
- Used by browser to subscribe to push
- Included in service worker registration

**Private Key:**
- MUST stay secret on server
- Only in Supabase Edge Functions
- Never sent to browser
- Used to sign push notifications

**Subject:**
- Identifies your app
- Format: `mailto:your-email@example.com`
- Used by push services for contact

### User Privacy

**Notification permissions:**
- User has full control
- Can be revoked anytime
- Respects system settings (Do Not Disturb, etc.)
- No tracking or analytics

**Data stored:**
- Push subscription endpoint (encrypted)
- Device info (user agent, platform)
- Notification preferences
- All stored in Supabase KV (encrypted)

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Popup Doesn't Appear

**Check:**
1. Are you on the dashboard screen?
2. Is the user connected (has a partner)?
3. Open console, look for: `🔔 Showing notification onboarding`
4. Check localStorage: `localStorage.getItem('adoras_notification_prompt_shown')`
5. If it's `'true'`, clear it: `localStorage.removeItem('adoras_notification_prompt_shown')`

**Force show popup:**
```javascript
// In browser console
localStorage.removeItem('adoras_notification_prompt_shown');
location.reload();
```

### VAPID Keys Not Working

**Check:**
1. All 3 secrets added to Supabase?
2. VAPID_SUBJECT starts with `mailto:`?
3. Waited 2 minutes after adding?
4. Console errors? Check for "VAPID key not available"

**Verify keys are set:**
```javascript
// In browser console on server function
console.log('Keys:', {
  public: Deno.env.get('VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY'),
  private: Deno.env.get('VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY') ? 'Set' : 'Not set',
  subject: Deno.env.get('VAPID_SUBJECT')
});
```

### Realtime Not Working

**Check:**
1. Realtime toggle is ON in Supabase dashboard?
2. Waited 2 minutes after enabling?
3. Console shows "Real-time channel connected"?
4. Network tab shows WebSocket connection?

**Test Realtime:**
```javascript
// In browser console
fetch('https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co/realtime/v1/')
  .then(r => console.log('Realtime status:', r.status))
  .catch(e => console.error('Realtime error:', e));
```

### Notifications Don't Send

**Check:**
1. User has enabled notifications?
2. Browser/system permissions granted?
3. Test button works in Notification Settings?
4. Console errors when sending?

**Test manually:**
```javascript
// In browser console
Notification.requestPermission().then(console.log);
// Should show: "granted"
```

### iOS Badge Not Updating

**Check:**
1. App installed as PWA (not Safari)?
2. "Badge App Icon" enabled in iOS Settings → Adoras?
3. Notifications enabled in iOS settings?

**Enable badge:**
1. Settings app → Adoras
2. Toggle "Badge App Icon" ON
3. Toggle "Show on Lock Screen" ON
4. Toggle "Banner" ON
