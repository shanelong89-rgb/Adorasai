## 🔍 **Quick Debug - If Something Fails:**

### **Photo doesn't display after upload:**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for errors after "📤 Uploading photo..."
3. Common issues:
   - ❌ "Photo upload failed" - Check Supabase Storage permissions
   - ❌ "Failed to create memory" - Check API connection
   - ❌ 401 Unauthorized - Re-login

### **Media disappears after refresh:**
1. Check console for "✅ Photo uploaded: ..."
2. If URL is present but photo doesn't load:
   - Signed URL might be expired (>1 hour old)
   - Phase 3b will fix this with auto-refresh

## 🎯 **Critical Test Points:**

| Test | What to Verify | Expected Result |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Upload** | Console shows "✅ uploaded" | Media URL logged |
| **Display** | Media shows in Chat | Visible immediately |
| **Persist** | Refresh page | Media still displays |
| **Library** | Check Media Library | Media appears in grid |
| **Metadata** | Long-press in Media Library (Keeper) | Edit dialog shows location, date, etc. |

## 💡 **Pro Tips:**

1. **Keep console open** - All upload steps are logged
2. **Test with real photos** - Metadata (EXIF date, GPS) will be extracted
3. **Try different file sizes** - Small files upload faster
4. **Test on different devices** - Media should sync across devices

## 🐛 **Report Issues:**

If you find a bug, provide:
1. Browser console screenshot (after the error)
2. Network tab screenshot (POST /memories request)
3. Steps to reproduce
4. What you expected vs. what happened
