**Flow:**

- Then proceeds to onboarding for profile details
- Credentials stored for signup after onboarding completes

---

### **3. Updated WelcomeScreen** (`/components/WelcomeScreen.tsx`)

Enhanced with authentication awareness:

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added `useAuth()` hook
- ✅ Auto-redirect if already authenticated
- ✅ Added `onLogin` prop for login navigation
- ✅ Checks `isAuthenticated` on mount
- ✅ Skips welcome if user has active session

**Behavior:**
- First-time users: See welcome → select flow
- Returning users: Auto-redirect to dashboard
- Session restoration: Seamless re-authentication

---

### **4. Updated App.tsx** (Main Application)

Complete authentication flow integration:

**New Screens:**
- `login` - Login screen
- `signup` - Email/password collection

**New Handlers:**
- `handleWelcomeLogin()` - Navigate to login
- `handleLoginSuccess()` - Navigate to dashboard after login
- `handleSignUpComplete()` - Store credentials, continue to onboarding

**Updated Flow:**
```
welcome
  ├→ userType (new signup)
  │    ↓
  │  signup (email/password)
  │    ↓
  │  keeperOnboarding / tellerOnboarding
  │    ↓
  │  dashboard
  │
  └→ login (existing user)
       ↓
     dashboard
```

**Wrapped with AuthProvider:**
- All screens have access to `useAuth()` hook
- Authentication state persists across refreshes
- Token automatically included in API calls

## 🔄 How the Flow Works

### **New User Signup Flow:**

```
1. WelcomeScreen
   User clicks "Get Started"
   ↓
2. UserTypeSelection
   User chooses Keeper or Teller
   ↓
3. SignUpInitialScreen
   User enters email + password
   Credentials validated
   ↓
4. KeeperOnboarding / TellerOnboarding
   User enters profile details
   (name, relationship, bio, etc.)
   ↓
5. Onboarding Complete
   → Will call signup API (Phase 1c)
   → Create account with all data
   ↓
6. Dashboard
   User is logged in and ready!
```

### **Existing User Login Flow:**

```
1. WelcomeScreen
   User clicks sign in option
   ↓
2. LoginScreen
   User enters email + password
   ↓
3. Auth Context calls signin()
   ↓
4. Dashboard
   User is logged in!
```

### **Returning User Flow:**

```
1. App loads
   ↓
2. AuthProvider checks localStorage
   ↓
3. Token found → Call GET /auth/me
   ↓
4. User profile loaded
   ↓
5. WelcomeScreen sees isAuthenticated=true
   ↓
6. Auto-redirect to Dashboard
   (Skip welcome, login, onboarding)
```

## ❌ What's Still Mock Data

These will be fixed in **Phase 1c**:

❌ Login actually calls API (ready but needs testing)

❌ Dashboard loads real connections (shows mock data)
❌ Dashboard loads real memories (shows mock data)
❌ Profile uses real user data (partially mock)
