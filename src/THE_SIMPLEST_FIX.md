3. **Reopen fresh**
4. **Log in**
5. **Try again**

## 🔧 Why This Works

- React state corrupted
- Event handlers detached
- Connection stale

**After:**
- Fresh state loaded
- New event handlers
- New real-time connection

**90%** - Works after first logout/login  
**95%** - Works after force quit + cache clear

## 🆘 Still Broken?
