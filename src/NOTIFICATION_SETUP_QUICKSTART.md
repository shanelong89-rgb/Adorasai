## ⚙️ Safari Feature Flags?

### Do NOT Change Them!

**Good news:** You don't need to enable any Safari feature flags.

**All PWA features work by default on iOS 16.4+:**
- ✅ Push notifications
- ✅ Service workers

**Only touch feature flags if you're a web developer testing experimental features.**

For Adoras: **Leave them alone!** 👍
