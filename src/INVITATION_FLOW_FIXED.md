# Invitation Flow Fixed ✅

## Problem Statement
The invitation system was showing TESTCODE to all users during onboarding, which:
- Connected new signups to the test keeper instead of the actual keeper
- Prevented real users from creating unique invitation codes
- Made TESTCODE appear in production instead of being development-only

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed TESTCODE from Keeper Onboarding
**File: `/components/KeeperOnboarding.tsx`**

- ✅ Removed hardcoded `TESTCODE` variable
- ✅ Removed Step 5 ("Invite your storyteller" with hardcoded code)
- ✅ Changed from 6-step to 5-step onboarding
- ✅ Updated step counter: "Step X of 5" instead of "Step X of 6"
- ✅ Added helpful message in Privacy Settings step explaining users can invite storytellers after completing onboarding via the Dashboard

**New Flow:**
1. Welcome
2. Tell us about yourself
3. Tell us about your storyteller
4. How it works
5. Privacy Settings ✨ (with note about inviting storytellers later)

### 2. Updated Teller Onboarding Placeholder
**File: `/components/TellerOnboarding.tsx`**

- ✅ Changed placeholder from `"Enter invitation code (e.g., TESTCODE)"` 
- ✅ To: `"Enter invitation code (e.g., FAM-2025-ABC123)"`
- ✅ Shows realistic example of actual invitation format

### 3. Backend TESTCODE Documentation
**File: `/supabase/functions/server/invitations.tsx`**

- ✅ Added clear comment: "⚠️ DEVELOPMENT/TESTING ONLY"
- ✅ Documented that TESTCODE should NOT appear in production
- ✅ Clarified that real invitations use unique codes generated by `generateInvitationCode()`

## How It Works Now

### For Legacy Keepers (Children)
1. Complete 5-step onboarding (no invitation code shown)
2. Land on Dashboard
3. Click "Invite Storyteller" button in Dashboard
4. Enter storyteller's name, relationship, and phone number
5. **System generates unique code** (e.g., `FAM-2025-XY9K7`)
6. SMS sent to storyteller with unique code

### For Storytellers (Parents/Elders)
1. Receive SMS with unique invitation code
2. Sign up and enter the unique code (not TESTCODE)
3. System connects them to the correct keeper
4. Can begin sharing memories

### For Testing/Development
- TESTCODE remains available for Shane Long ↔ Allison Tam testing
- ONLY activates when code is exactly "TESTCODE"
- Auto-creates/resets connection between test users
- Clearly labeled as development-only in code comments

## Invitation Code Format

**Real Invitations:**
- Format: `FAM-YYYY-XXXXX` (e.g., `FAM-2025-XY9K7`)
- Generated by: `generateInvitationCode()` function
- Unique for each invitation
- Valid for 7 days

**Test Code:**
- Format: `TESTCODE` (exact match only)
- Only for development/testing
- Auto-creates connection to Shane Long
- Valid for 90 days (extended for testing)

## Files Modified

1. `/components/KeeperOnboarding.tsx` - Complete rewrite to 5-step flow
2. `/components/TellerOnboarding.tsx` - Updated placeholder text
3. `/supabase/functions/server/invitations.tsx` - Added development-only comments

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Keeper signs up and completes 5-step onboarding
- [ ] Keeper lands on Dashboard (no TESTCODE shown)
- [ ] Keeper clicks "Invite Storyteller" from Dashboard
- [ ] System generates unique invitation code (FAM-2025-XXXXX format)
- [ ] SMS sent with unique code (if Twilio configured)
- [ ] Teller receives SMS with unique code
- [ ] Teller signs up and enters unique code
- [ ] Connection established between correct keeper and teller
- [ ] TESTCODE still works for Shane ↔ Allison testing
- [ ] TESTCODE does not interfere with production signups

## Benefits

✅ **Production Ready**: TESTCODE hidden from real users
✅ **Unique Codes**: Each invitation gets a unique code
✅ **Correct Connections**: Tellers connect to the right keepers
✅ **Test Friendly**: TESTCODE still available for development
✅ **Clear UX**: Users guided to create invitations from Dashboard
✅ **Professional**: No test artifacts visible to end users

## Next Steps

After users complete onboarding, they can:
1. Explore the Dashboard
2. Create real invitations via the "Invite Storyteller" button
3. Share memories once connection is established
4. View all their connections in the Dashboard
