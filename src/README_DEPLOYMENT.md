# 🚀 Adoras Deployment - Quick Start

## ⚡ TL;DR - 3-Step Fix

Your Vercel deployment is failing because of **3 configuration issues**. Here's the fastest fix:

### 1️⃣ Create `.npmrc` file in your GitHub repo root
```
legacy-peer-deps=true
```

### 2️⃣ Update `package.json` in your GitHub repo
Change this line:
```json
"date-fns": "^4.1.0"  ❌
```
To:
```json
"date-fns": "^3.0.0"  ✅
```

### 3️⃣ Update `vercel.json` in your GitHub repo
Change this line:
```json
"outputDirectory": "build"  ❌
```
To:
```json
"outputDirectory": "dist"  ✅
```

**Then commit and push.** ✨

## 🎯 Your Deployment Errors Explained

### Error 1: `date-fns` Version Conflict
```
npm error peer date-fns@"^2.28.0 || ^3.0.0" from react-day-picker@8.10.1
npm error   date-fns@"^4.1.0" from the root project
```

**Why:** `react-day-picker` requires `date-fns` version 2.x or 3.x, but your GitHub repo has 4.x

**Fix:** Change to `"date-fns": "^3.0.0"` in package.json + add `.npmrc` with `legacy-peer-deps=true`

---

### Error 2: JSR Package Not Found
```
npm error 404  '@jsr/supabase__supabase-js@^2.49.8' is not in this registry
```

**Why:** Your GitHub repo has a reference to a non-existent `@jsr/` package

**Fix:** Use `"@supabase/supabase-js": "^2.39.0"` (no @jsr prefix)

---

### Error 3: Output Directory Mismatch
```
Error: No Output Directory named "dist" found after the Build completed
```

**Why:** Vite builds to `dist/` but your `vercel.json` was looking for `build/`

**Fix:** Update `vercel.json` to use `"outputDirectory": "dist"`

---

### Error 4: Vite Command Not Found
```
sh: line 1: vite: command not found
```

**Why:** Missing `vite` in `devDependencies` or incorrect build command

**Fix:** Ensure `package.json` has `"vite": "^5.0.0"` in devDependencies

---

## 🌐 Connecting Your Custom Domain (adoras.ai)

**AFTER deployment succeeds:**

### In Vercel:
1. Go to your project
2. Settings → Domains
3. Click "Add Domain"
4. Enter `adoras.ai`

### In Your Domain Registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.):
Add these DNS records:

```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 76.76.21.21 (check Vercel for current IP)

Type: CNAME  
Name: www
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
```

### Wait 5-60 minutes for DNS to propagate

### Verify:
- Visit https://adoras.ai
- SSL should be auto-configured
- Should load your app
