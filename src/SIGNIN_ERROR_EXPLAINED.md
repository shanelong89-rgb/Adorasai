# Sign In Error: "Invalid Login Credentials" - EXPLAINED

## ✅ This is NOT a Bug - It's Expected Behavior

The error you're seeing:
```
❌ Error signing in: Error: Sign in failed: Invalid login credentials
```

**This is working correctly!** This error means:

1. ❌ **The user account doesn't exist** - You need to sign up first
2. ❌ **The password is incorrect** - Check your password
3. ❌ **The email is mistyped** - Verify the email address

---

## 🔧 How to Fix This

### Option 1: Create a New Account (Sign Up First)

If you don't have an account yet:

1. Click **"Create New Account"** on the login screen
2. Fill out the sign-up form
3. Complete the onboarding process
4. Then you can sign in with those credentials

### Option 2: Use Correct Credentials

If you already have an account:

1. Make sure you're using the **exact email** you signed up with
2. Make sure you're using the **correct password**
3. Email addresses are case-insensitive but passwords are case-sensitive

## 🧪 Testing with Test Users

If you want to test with pre-created users, you need to:

### Create Test Users via Sign Up Flow

1. Go through the sign-up flow to create a "Legacy Keeper" (child) account
   - Email: `shane@test.com`
   - Password: `password123`
   - Name: Shane
   - etc.

2. Create a "Storyteller" (parent) account  
   - Email: `allison@test.com`
   - Password: `password123`
   - Name: Allison
   - etc.

3. Connect them using the invitation system

### Or Use the Backend to Create Users Programmatically

You can create a test endpoint to pre-populate users. But the current system requires going through the signup flow.

## 🔍 What the Error Logs Mean

When you see this in the server logs:

```
🔐 Signing in user: test@example.com
❌ Sign in failed: Invalid login credentials
```

This means Supabase Auth checked its database and found:
- ❌ No user exists with that email/password combination

This is **correct behavior** - it's protecting the system by rejecting invalid credentials.

---

## 💡 Current System Status

✅ **Working Correctly:**
- Authentication system is functioning
- Error handling is working
- Security is working (rejecting invalid credentials)

❌ **NOT Broken:**
- This is not a bug
- No code changes needed
- System is operating as designed

---

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **If testing:** Create accounts through the signup flow first
2. **If using the app:** Sign up before trying to sign in
3. **If you forgot credentials:** Currently no password reset (would need to be added)

---

## 🚀 Summary

**The error is expected!** You can't sign in if you haven't signed up. The system is working correctly by rejecting invalid credentials. Just create an account first through the signup flow, then you can sign in with those credentials.
