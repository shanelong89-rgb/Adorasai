# 🔔 Test Notifications NOW - Quick Guide

## ✅ THE FIX

**I just fixed the backend!** It was only logging notifications, not actually sending them.

**Updated:** `/supabase/functions/server/notifications.tsx`
- ✅ Added `web-push` library
- ✅ Now sends REAL push notifications
- ✅ Fully encrypted with VAPID keys

---

## 🚀 Test in 60 Seconds

### 1. Verify VAPID Keys (10 seconds)

https://supabase.com/dashboard → Edge Functions → Secrets

**Check these exist:**
- ✅ `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`
- ✅ `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`  
- ✅ `VAPID_SUBJECT`

**Missing?** Add from `/VAPID_KEYS_FOR_SUPABASE.txt`

---

### 2. Verify Realtime (5 seconds)

https://supabase.com/dashboard → Settings → API

**Check:**
- ✅ Realtime toggle is **ON (green)**

**OFF?** Turn it ON, wait 2 minutes

---

### 3. Hard Refresh App (5 seconds)

**Desktop:** `Ctrl + Shift + R`

**iOS:**
1. Delete app from home screen
2. Safari → Share → Add to Home Screen
3. Open from home screen

**Android:** Clear cache or reinstall

---

### 4. Test It! (30 seconds)

1. **Log in** to Adoras
2. **Menu (☰)** → Notification Settings
3. **Check:** Should show "Subscribed" ✅
   - If "Not subscribed" → Click "Enable Notifications"
4. **Click:** "Send Test Notification"  
5. **Wait:** 2-5 seconds
6. **🎉 NOTIFICATION SHOULD APPEAR!**

---

## ❌ Not Working?

### Check Backend Logs

https://supabase.com/dashboard → Edge Functions → Logs

**Click test notification, then look for:**

**✅ GOOD (Working):**
```
Sending push notification to user: user_xxx
✅ Push notification delivered successfully
Notification sent to 1 subscriptions
```

**❌ BAD (Not working):**
```
VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY not configured
```
→ **Fix:** Add VAPID keys

```
No active subscriptions for user
```
→ **Fix:** Enable notifications in app

```
Subscription expired
```
→ **Fix:** Disable then re-enable notifications

---

### Check Browser Console

**Press F12 → Console**

**✅ GOOD:**
```
✅ Successfully subscribed to push notifications
✅ Test notification sent
```

**❌ BAD:**
```
❌ VAPID key not available
```
→ **Fix:** Add VAPID keys to Supabase

```
❌ Failed to subscribe to push notifications
```
→ **Fix:** Check permissions, reinstall PWA (iOS)

---

### iOS-Specific Checks

**Settings App:**
1. Settings → Adoras
2. Notifications → **Must be ON** ✅
3. Badge App Icon → **Must be ON** ✅
4. Lock Screen → **ON**
5. Banners → **ON**

**PWA Installation:**
- Installed on home screen? ✅
- Opens full screen (no Safari UI)? ✅
- If Safari shows URL bar → REINSTALL!

**iOS Requirements:**
- iOS 16.4+ only
- Safari only (not Chrome)
- MUST be installed as PWA
- MUST open from home screen icon

---

## 📊 Quick Diagnostic

**Run in browser console (F12):**

```javascript
// Check everything
console.log('Permission:', Notification.permission);
navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then(reg => {
  reg.pushManager.getSubscription().then(sub => {
    console.log('Subscribed:', !!sub);
    if (sub) console.log('Endpoint:', sub.endpoint.substring(0, 50));
  });
});
```

**Expected:**
```
Permission: "granted"
Subscribed: true
Endpoint: https://fcm.googleapis.com/fcm/send/...
```

---

## ✅ Success Checklist

When it works, you'll see ALL of these:

- ✅ Notification Settings shows "Subscribed"
- ✅ Test button works (notification in 2-5 seconds)
- ✅ Notification banner appears
- ✅ Badge count on app icon (iOS)
- ✅ Sound/vibration plays
- ✅ Backend logs: "✅ Push notification delivered successfully"
- ✅ Console: "✅ Successfully subscribed to push notifications"

---

## 🔥 Common Issues

### "Would send notification to..." in logs

**Cause:** Old backend code (before fix)

**Fix:**
- Wait 5 minutes for auto-deploy
- OR manually redeploy Edge Function
- Hard refresh app after deploy

---

### Test button does nothing

**Check:**
1. F12 → Console → Look for errors
2. Supabase → Edge Functions → Logs → Look for errors
3. VAPID keys added? (most common issue!)
4. User subscribed? (check Notification Settings)

---

### iOS: Notifications don't appear

**99% cause:** Not installed as PWA

**Fix:**
1. Open in Safari (not Chrome!)
2. Share → Add to Home Screen
3. Open from home screen icon (NOT Safari!)
4. Should be full screen (no browser UI)
5. Enable notifications when prompted
6. Settings → Adoras → All toggles ON

---

### Backend error: "web-push module not found"

**Cause:** Backend deployment issue

**Fix:**
1. Supabase will auto-install npm dependencies
2. Wait 5 minutes
3. Or manually redeploy Edge Function

---

## 🎯 The Main Fix

**Before:**
```typescript
// For now, log the notification
console.log('Would send notification to:', ...);
```
= NO notifications sent ❌

**After:**
```typescript
await webpush.sendNotification(subscription, payload);
console.log('✅ Push notification delivered');
```
= REAL notifications! ✅
