# Invitation Management System - Complete Implementation

## Overview
The Adoras app now has a comprehensive invitation management system that allows users to:
1. **Create invitations** for NEW users (via phone/SMS)
2. **Connect with EXISTING users** (via email - no invitation codes needed)
3. **Manage all sent invitations** (view, copy codes, delete pending invitations)

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Invitation Dialog (`/components/InvitationDialog.tsx`)
**Features:**
- **Two-tab interface** for Legacy Keepers:
  - **"New User" tab**: Send SMS invitation with phone number (existing flow)
  - **"Existing User" tab**: Connect instantly via email address (new flow)
- **Single flow for Storytellers**: Accept invitation code (unchanged)

**How it works:**
- When a Keeper enters an existing user's email, the system:
  1. Searches for that user in the database
  2. Creates an immediate connection (no invitation code needed)
  3. Both users can start sharing memories right away

### 2. Invitation Management Page (`/components/InvitationManagement.tsx`)
**Features:**
- View all sent invitations organized by status:
  - **Pending**: Active invitations waiting to be accepted
  - **Accepted**: Successfully connected invitations
  - **Expired**: Invitations past their expiration date
- **For each invitation, see:**
  - Invitation code (with copy button)
  - Phone number (with copy button)
  - Contact name and relationship
  - Status badge (color-coded)
  - Sent date and expiration/acceptance date
- **Actions:**
  - Copy invitation codes and phone numbers to clipboard
  - Delete pending or expired invitations
  - Refresh the list
  - Create new invitations

**Access:** Only available to Legacy Keepers via the hamburger menu â†’ "Manage Invitations"

### 3. Backend Enhancements

#### New Functions (`/supabase/functions/server/invitations.tsx`):
- **`connectViaEmail()`**: Creates instant connection between existing users
  - Validates email address
  - Checks if user exists
  - Prevents self-connection and duplicate connections
  - Creates bidirectional connection immediately
- **`deleteInvitation()`**: Removes pending/expired invitations
  - Validates ownership (only creator can delete)
  - Prevents deletion of accepted invitations (connection exists)
  - Cleans up database entries

#### New API Routes (`/supabase/functions/server/index.tsx`):
- **POST** `/make-server-deded1eb/invitations/connect-email`
  - Body: `{ email: string }`
  - Connects with existing user via email
- **DELETE** `/make-server-deded1eb/invitations/:code`
  - Deletes invitation by code
  - Protected: requires authentication

#### Client API Methods (`/utils/api/client.ts`):
- `connectViaEmail(email: string)`
- `deleteInvitation(code: string)`

### 4. UI Integration

**Dashboard Menu** (`/components/Dashboard.tsx`):
- Added "Manage Invitations" menu item (Keepers only)
- Located between "Create Invitation" and "Notifications"
- Opens the InvitationManagement dialog

**App Flow** (`/components/AppContent.tsx`):
- New handler: `handleConnectViaEmail()`
- Passed down to Dashboard â†’ InvitationDialog
- Triggers connection creation and UI refresh

## User Flows

### Flow 1: Keeper Invites NEW User (Phone/SMS)
1. Click hamburger menu â†’ "Create Invitation"
2. Select "New User" tab
3. Enter name, relationship, and phone number
4. Click "Send Invitation"
5. System sends SMS with invitation code (if Twilio configured)
6. New user receives code and signs up using it

### Flow 2: Keeper Connects with EXISTING User (Email)
1. Click hamburger menu â†’ "Create Invitation"
2. Select "Existing User" tab
3. Enter their email address
4. Click "Send Request"
5. System creates instant connection (no code needed)
6. Both users can immediately see each other and share memories

### Flow 3: Keeper Manages Invitations
1. Click hamburger menu â†’ "Manage Invitations"
2. View all invitations organized by status
3. Copy invitation codes to share manually
4. Delete pending invitations if needed
5. Click "Create New" to send another invitation

### Flow 4: Storyteller Accepts Invitation (Unchanged)
1. Click hamburger menu â†’ "Join Connection"
2. Enter invitation code received via SMS
3. Click "Join Connection"
4. Connection established, can start sharing memories

## Database Schema

### Connection with Email (No Invitation Code)
When connecting via email, the system creates:
```typescript
{
  id: "conn_xyz",
  keeperId: "user_abc",
  tellerId: "user_def",
  status: "active",
  invitationCode: "EMAIL-1234567890", // Dummy code for tracking
  createdAt: "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  acceptedAt: "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Invitation States
- **sent**: Invitation created, waiting for acceptance
- **accepted**: User has accepted and connection is established
- **expired**: Invitation past expiration date (7 days default)

## Security Features

1. **Email Connection Validation:**
   - User must exist in system
   - Cannot connect with yourself
   - Prevents duplicate connections
   - Requires authentication

2. **Invitation Deletion:**
   - Only creator can delete their invitations
   - Cannot delete accepted invitations (connection established)
   - Properly cleans up database entries

3. **Authorization:**
   - All API endpoints require valid access token
   - User-specific data only accessible to owner

## Error Handling

**Email Connection Errors:**
- "No Adoras user found with this email address" â†’ User doesn't exist
- "You cannot connect with yourself" â†’ Same user
- "You are already connected with [Name]" â†’ Duplicate connection

**Invitation Deletion Errors:**
- "Invitation not found" â†’ Invalid code
- "Unauthorized" â†’ Not your invitation
- "Cannot delete accepted invitations" â†’ Connection already exists

## UI/UX Features

### Visual Feedback
- **Status badges** with color coding:
  - ðŸ”µ Blue = Pending
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green = Accepted
  - âš« Gray = Expired
- **Loading states** for all async operations
- **Toast notifications** for success/error feedback
- **Empty states** with helpful guidance

### Responsive Design
- Works on mobile and desktop
- Scrollable list for many invitations
- Touch-friendly buttons and actions
- Proper spacing and typography

### Accessibility
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA-compliant dialogs
- Keyboard navigation support
- Clear visual hierarchy
