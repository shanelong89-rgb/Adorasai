# ⚡ RUN THIS NOW - Real-Time Fix

## 🎯 THE ISSUE

Real-time sync won't connect if `isConnected = false`

This is likely why messages aren't appearing live!

---

## 🧪 STEP 1: Check Connection Status

**Copy/paste this in browser console (F12):**

```javascript
console.clear();
const keys = Object.keys(localStorage);
const stateKey = keys.find(k => k.includes('adorasAppState'));
const state = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(stateKey));

console.log('USER:', state.userProfile?.name);
console.log('PARTNER:', state.partnerProfile?.name);
console.log('IS_CONNECTED:', state.isConnected ? '✅ TRUE' : '❌ FALSE');

if (!state.isConnected) {
  console.log('\n❌ PROBLEM: isConnected = false');
  console.log('Real-time sync will NOT connect!');
  console.log('\n✅ FIX: Log out and log back in');
} else {
  console.log('\n✅ Connection status is good');
}
```

---

## ✅ IF IT SAYS `isConnected = FALSE`

### THE FIX (Takes 30 seconds):

1. **Log out** of Adoras (menu → Log Out)
2. **Log back in**
3. **Run the script again**
4. **Should now say `isConnected = TRUE`**
5. **Test sending a message**

---

## ❌ IF STILL FALSE AFTER RE-LOGIN

### Then the connection doesn't exist in the database.

**You need to:**
1. Redo the invitation flow
2. User A sends invitation
3. User B accepts
4. Both log in
5. Check isConnected again

---

## ✅ IF IT SAYS `isConnected = TRUE`

### Then check if real-time is actually connecting:

**Look in console for:**
```
🔌 Setting up real-time sync...
🔌 Connecting to real-time channel: conn_xxx
✅ Real-time channel connected!
```

**If you DON'T see this:**
- Scroll up in console
- Look for errors
- Look for "⚠️ Real-time channel error"

---

## 🎯 EXPECTED OUTCOME

**When working:**

```
USER: Shane
PARTNER: Allison  
IS_CONNECTED: ✅ TRUE

✅ Connection status is good

🔌 Setting up real-time sync...
🔌 Connecting to real-time channel: conn_abc123
✅ Real-time channel connected!
👤 Presence tracked: { userId: "xxx", userName: "Shane", online: true }
```

**Then:**
- Send a message
- Partner sees it instantly ✅
- No refresh needed ✅
- Notifications work ✅
